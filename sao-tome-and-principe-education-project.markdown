DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) was hired to support an international oil and gas company to validate and implement its education project in Sao Tome and Principe. This involved an initial stakeholder validation in Sao Tome and Principe through multiple consultations with stakeholders including the Ministry of Education, UNICEF, corporations, and local and international nongovernmental groups. These consultations were complemented with a desktop document review of available reports and government policy and strategy documents. After validating the Education project concept, SBG supported the client to fully design the program. A key element of the design was the identification of locations/sites for implementation of the schools. Sites were selected on the basis of a range of criteria including student population of the district, road access, infrastructure access (water, electricity, sanitation), distance to other school facilities, land availability, and teacher availability. Once all sites were selected, SBG supported the client with the execution of the project by developing a draft scope of work for the construction project and performing an initial assessment of available contractors in the market. The last area of support provided by SBG was supporting the client in engaging with the Minister of Education of Sao Tome and Principe to achieve a signed memorandum of understanding to progress with the education project.
