In accordance with the provisions of the Sierra Leone Local Content Agency Act of 2016, the Sierra Leone Local Content Agency (LCA) is obligated to establish an online portal and scorecard system to simplify and assure standardization in the way in which companies report their local content performance data. To this end, DAI’s proprietary Local Content Plan and Reporting Platform ([LCPR](https://www.dai.com/our-work/local-content-plan-and-report)) software was configured to meet the LCA’s needs over the course of a GIZ-funded contract from 2016 to 2017.
 
In November 2019, GIZ and the LCA engaged SBG for a second contract, to ensure the submission of data in LCPR by the companies covered by the LCA’s mandate and to improve the quality of data being reported. DAI’s tasks also include assisting companies to prepare their three-year Local Content Plans, with targets, and supporting the LCA in the hiring of an individual in Sierra Leone to be trained as the LCPR Portal Consultant. The intention is that the LCA will hire this person at the end of the contract period to continue DAI’s work, ensuring the sustainability of the platform and project. 

To date, DAI has contacted the 36 companies covered by the LCA’s mandate, guiding them on data submissions and providing user support when needed. These companies come from several sectors: agriculture, banking, hospitality, ICT, insurance, logistics and transport, manufacturing, mining, oil and gas, and services. 

Compliance and data reporting have been increased, and analytical Local Content Performance Reports have been produced for 2019 and 2020. An LCPR Portal Consultant has been hired and now sits within the LCA in Sierra Leone.
