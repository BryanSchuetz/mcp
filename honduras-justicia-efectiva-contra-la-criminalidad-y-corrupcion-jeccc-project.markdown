Impunity in Honduras remains persistently high, which is exacerbated by corruption and crime that reduce public trust and weaken the independence of judicial institutions. This results in an erosion of security that drives many vulnerable Hondurans to migrate irregularly each year. Within this challenging context, *Justicia Efectiva* has identified ‘bright spots’ such as a vibrant civil society, opportunities for building solid partnerships with multi-sectoral actors, and political will among justice operators, all of which present strategic entry points.

*Justicia Efectiva* employs a comprehensive, people-centered approach to improve access to justice, enhance the effectiveness of the criminal justice system, and build trust in public institutions. This is achieved through innovative solutions across the Activity’s four strategic themes that enhance interinstitutional and multi-sectoral coordination and promote judicial independence: strategic criminal prosecution, local justice systems, people-centered justice, and open justice.

Through these themes, *Justicia Efectiva* strengthens democracy and the rule of law in Honduras by supporting civil society oversight and addresses the needs of vulnerable groups by improving judicial services, to rebuild the social contract between the government and its people. In doing so, the project tackles the root governance issues that underlie drivers of irregular migration, such as violence, impunity, and insecurity.
