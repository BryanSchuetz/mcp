Nigeria is the largest country in Africa, where 2,100 children under the age of 5 die every day from diseases easily preventable with better hygiene, improved sanitation, and access to clean drinking water. It is a paradox that even in states with an abundance of water resources, and access to water and sanitation remains very poor. The average water service delivery is only 32 litres per capita per day in urban areas and 10 litres in small towns and rural areas, while the quality is in most cases suspect.

The Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Reform Programme Phase III (WSSSRPIII) worked to solve this problem by contributing to poverty reduction, sustainable development, and to the achievement of the water and sanitation-related Millennium Development Goals, in three states—Adamawa, Ekiti, and Plateau. Our team worked to improve water governance and institutional capacity for increased access to safe, adequate and sustainable water, and sanitation and hygiene services. 

The territory covered by the project is home to more than 10 million people who benefited from this project. The main beneficiaries were people living in densely populated areas, peri-urban areas, small towns, and villages with no sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.
