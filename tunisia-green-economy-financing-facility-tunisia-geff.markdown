The Tunisia Green Economy Financing Facility (Tunisia GEFF) is a €130 million credit facility channeled through Tunisian banks and leasing companies to private sector sub-borrowers for investment in technologies and services that support the transition to a green economy.
 
Tunisia GEFF, similar to [other such facilities](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/morocco-sustainable-energy-financing-facility-morseff) implemented by DAI, addresses a lack of available capital and experience which has hindered Tunisian businesses’ uptake of sustainable and efficient energy technologies and practices. These types of facilities have facilitated hundreds of green finance deals, leading to positive financial and environmental outcomes for businesses, residents, and communities.

### Sample Activities
