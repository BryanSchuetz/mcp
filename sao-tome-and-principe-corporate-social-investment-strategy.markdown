DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) worked with an international oil and gas company to collaboratively scope and design a major social investment program for Sao Tome and Principe, focused on promoting youth entrepreneurship and innovation. The work began with design workshops with the client followed by stakeholder consultation in the field. SBG led several trips over four months to meet with dozens of stakeholders in government, universities, nongovernmental organizations, financial sector, and more. The team designed a program to promote entrepreneurship and sustainable jobs for young people in Sao Tome and Principe across three key sectors: agriculture, fisheries, and tourism.
