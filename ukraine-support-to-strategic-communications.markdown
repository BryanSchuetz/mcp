*[Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, DAI’s programs in Ukraine have had to adapt their modes of operation and in some cases their underlying activities and objectives. This project description remains generally accurate but should be read with that caveat in mind.]*

In 2019, European integration was included as a strategic priority in Ukraine’s Constitution. Since then, the Ukrainian government has implemented reforms and developed plans to be further integrated into the European Union. Ambitious reform programs rely on the support of citizens and strategic communications are key to ensuring this public buy-in.

DAI’s project worked to increase the strategic communications capacity of the Ukrainian Government, with an overall objective of ensuring the public’s awareness and understanding of reform processes throughout the country and fighting disinformation. Our team worked with public administrations to strengthen their capacities to design, launch, assess, and adapt communications campaigns for local, national, and international audiences.
