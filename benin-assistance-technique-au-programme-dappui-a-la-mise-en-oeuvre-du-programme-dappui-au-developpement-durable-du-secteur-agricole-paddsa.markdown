The project provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries (APRM) for the implementation of the Programme d’Appui au Développement Durable du Secteur Agricole (PADDSA), a €70 million initiative to reform Benin’s agricultural sector.

Our assistance combined with complementary support delegated to the Belgian Technical Cooperation, which ensured the capacity building of local stakeholders. PADDSA’s complementary support mechanism ensured the coherence of interventions designed to reform the agriculture, livestock, and fisheries sectors in Benin. 

Our project team focused on building the capacity of institutions involved in steering sectoral policy, consolidating the national agricultural statistics and information systems, and improving the general framework for financing agricultural development.
