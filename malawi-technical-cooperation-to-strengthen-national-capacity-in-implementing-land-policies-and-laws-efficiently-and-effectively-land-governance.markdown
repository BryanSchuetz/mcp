The Malawi Land Governance programme, funded by the European Union, enhanced people’s livelihoods and food security through sustainable agricultural development, with an emphasis on remote rural areas. To better align the country’s land governance framework, DAI worked with government counterparts to develop and implement land policy reforms. Our team served in both advisory and capacity-building roles, providing government officials with skills to create and review effective land policy, as well as helping design procedures to carry out reforms at the national level. The overall objective of the project was to improve the livelihoods of the population, particularly in rural areas of the country through sustainable agricultural development in Malawi. By the end of the programme, the institutional framework and capacity were strengthened at all levels for an efficient and effective land reform programme. Smallholder farmers’ land rights were improved, in particular women's, due to responsible land governance at the local level guided by principles enshrined in the [Voluntary Guidelines on the Governance of Tenure](http://www.fao.org/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/) (VGGT).
