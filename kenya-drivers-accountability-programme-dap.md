Following the post-election violence of 2007–2008 in Kenya, the need for an overhaul of the constitutional, legislative, electoral, and judicial environment became critical. To address the issues of impunity and lack of accountability that fed into the unrest, the former U.K. Department for International Development (now called Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office) and the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) jointly supported the Drivers of Accountability Programme (DAP) to improve the Kenyan government’s accountability to its citizens.

DAP supported key reforms and built on efforts to strengthen oversight and increase the demand for accountability and better governance, helping Kenya to become a more stable democracy. The project supported a wide range of civil society groups, media, oversight bodies, and independent commissions to influence and deliver governance reforms in Kenya.
