DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) provided strategic advisory services to Chevron’s Partnerships Initiative in the Niger Delta (PIND) Foundation to support it in developing a strategy for its next funding cycle. SBG helped to identify, based on perspectives of Foundation staff, how to utilize the organization’s core strengths and successes to develop a collective 2020 vision. SBG led a series of workshops and research efforts to collect data and insights from PIND staff, including through surveys and a series of in-person workshops. From these insights, we conducted detailed analysis on the organization’s strategic vision, its development of cross-cutting themes, and program areas and teams. SBG synthesized our findings into a final report to the organizations’ leadership that outlined a collective 2020 vision for NDPI and PIND’s roles in tackling social and economic development challenges in the Niger Delta.
