DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) worked with a multinational mining company to assess the company’s Local Business Integration (LBI) program and conducted a gap analysis to inform recommendations for optimizing supplier development. We conducted a two-phase analysis which was comprised of a comprehensive review of all LBI documentation, policies, and procedures, followed by in-person interviews with staff, local companies, and local stakeholders.  

The findings from each phase were used to highlight the gaps between documented LBI commitments and on-the-ground implementation of the program. Based on these findings, SBG provided a detailed action plan to help the client develop its LBI technical capacity and implement a robust supplier development program.
