The West Bank and Gaza face major threats to their economic growth and the resulting employment opportunities for Palestinians. Political instability and the sluggish economy in 2019 and early 2020 were already hurting job growth and will be hurt even more by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While more than 3,000 Palestinian university students graduate each year with an IT background, relatively few get employed in the IT sector because they do not have the requisite skills to respond to the demands of the IT firms and those firms’ end-market clients. IT remains a promising and growing sector, though, accounting for 15 percent of service exports in 2017.

The [TechStart](https://www.techstart.ps/en) program is designed to assist the Palestinian IT ecosystem in upgrading firm capabilities and spur employment growth. TechStart builds the capacity of Palestinian firms, strengthens demand from international buyers and investors, and stimulates the absorption of high-tech knowledge in the ecosystem.

### Sample Activities

* Strengthen the capabilities of firms and their workforces, addressing capability shortfalls, information asymmetries, and other factors that dissuade firms from investing in capacity-building activities independently. 
* Support the entry of new, complementary actors into the IT ecosystem, aiding the private sector to build the technology and business infrastructure that IT service companies rely on to compete, including finance. 
* Stimulate demand through international market linkages and will encourage foreign direct investment in the West Bank and Gaza.
