The Social Protection Technical Assistance, Advice, and Resources Facility (STAAR) is an initiative of the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth, & Development Office (FCDO). Actors from national governments, donors, and implementing partners are encouraged to access the Facility for free, with direct support from STAAR’s independent technical assistance, specialist advice, or bespoke resources.

Social protection reduces both poverty and inequality. Predictable access to support, when it is needed, empowers people to navigate foreseeable and unexpected risks throughout their lives and can help them overcome deeply ingrained inequalities.

Strengthening social protection systems directly benefits people living in, or at risk of, crises caused by conflict, political and economic instability, or environmental fragility. [Linking traditional humanitarian assistance](https://www.calpnetwork.org/blog/five-practical-insights-on-linking-humanitarian-assistance-and-social-protection/)—which provides the bulk of support to conflict-affected communities—with social protection systems can build people’s resilience to crises and increase human capital.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted just how powerful social protection can be as a tool for crisis response. It has been used by governments across the globe to help people manage the economic fallout of the pandemic. Critically, those countries with stronger routine social protection systems have been able to meet emerging needs more quickly and effectively than others.

Social protection has genuine potential to close gaps in education, health, and economic opportunities. In relation to girls’ education, for example, program poverty and vulnerability assessments of the social protection system should map girls’ and boys’ access to and success in education, while benefits packages might include a scale-up of school feeding to maximize attention spans.

A key element of STAAR's activities is supporting the FCDO’s Ukraine Humanitarian Response Programme (UHRP). UHRP assistance focuses on including Ukrainian refugees in regional social protection programs and improving linkages between humanitarian cash actors and government social protection systems in Ukraine. In particular, STAAR will support the PeReHID initiative, which was launched in 2023 as a collaboration between the Government of Ukraine, humanitarian agencies, and development partners. PeReHID supports a sustainable transition and absorption of humanitarian caseloads into an inclusive, shock-responsive national social protection system, working to strengthen Ukraine's social protection system so that it is fairer, more inclusive, and more responsive. By improving the coordination of government and humanitarian efforts and increasing the sustainability of assistance, PeReHID aims to reduce dependency on parallel interventions.
