Türkiye is at increasing risk of water scarcity due to its growing population, infrastructural developments, overexploitation of watersheds, pollution, and changes in climate. The development of river basin management plans is important for the sustainable management of water and is part of Türkiye’s implementation of the [European Union Environmental acquis](http://www.ecranetwork.org/Horizontal-Activities/Handbook-EU-Environmental-Acquis).

DAI is strengthening Türkiye’s capacity to prepare river basin management plans for six out of the 25 river basins in the country. The plans summarise the state of the water environment; pressures affecting the water environment where its status is less than good; set statutory objectives for river, lake, groundwater, transitional, and coastal water bodies; and contain measures needed to achieve them.

The plans will be developed following the [European Union Water Framework Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/index_en.html) (WFD), which requires member states to improve the health of river basins in the European Union by 2027.

## Sample Activities

* Analyse data requirements and collect required data from Ankara and on-site, and provide a data requirement analysis report.
* Review river basin districts, water bodies, typologies, classes, and categories.
* Analyse the pressure and impacts on water bodies.
* Update monitoring programs for the six basins.
* Prepare significant water management issues reports.
* Conduct a study visit to an EU Member State to evaluate their experience with the significant water management issues.
* Create sectoral water allocation plans, environmental assessment reports, and a case study on environmental and health impacts of implementing environmental quality standards.

## Select Results

* Organized an opening event with the participation of more than 600 attendees from various stakeholders.
* Organized six stakeholder consultation meetings in the basins of the project, with more than 600 attendees.
* Facilitated an inception workshop on characterization issues with 60 practitioners.
* Organized high-level study visits to Denmark, Finland, and Spain.
* Prepared reports on water management issues and sectoral use of water.
* Produced an inventory of priority substances and specific pollutants that are used and/or discharged by industrial facilities, urban wastewater treatment plants, and agricultural activities.
