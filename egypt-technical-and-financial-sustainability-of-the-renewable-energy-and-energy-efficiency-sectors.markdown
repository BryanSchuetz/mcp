As Egypt continues to rebuild its economy it faces many challenges, including regional unrest and a slowdown in exports due to muted global growth. National security remains a concern. Nevertheless, Egypt’s economy has continued to expand.

Up to June 2019, the country had an estimated electricity shortage of 30.4 gigawatts, according to the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy. The gap between supply and demand will worsen with the expected increase in gross domestic product in the coming years. Egypt is now searching for solutions. DAI created the Cairo Energy Efficiency Centre to promote the use of renewable energy and spread awareness of energy saving. The team also supported reforms in the energy sector by assisting Egypt to achieve sustainable energy and security of energy supplies.
