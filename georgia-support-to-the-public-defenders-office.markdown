The Republic of Georgia has experienced challenges to some of its public institutions, especially in areas related to the judiciary and democratic oversight. The Public Defender’s Office (PDO) is empowered to make recommendations to authorities in cases of human rights violations and can lodge complaints in the Constitutional Court if people’s rights and freedoms are violated by legislative acts. The PDO also plays an important educational role in promoting observance of the rule of law.

Our project supports the PDO to improve its ability to implement and monitor human rights policies and actions and raise human rights awareness across government and society.

The project is in line with the European Union’s Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy for 2020-2024, which makes human rights, democracy, and rule of law central to its activities, including in external relations.
