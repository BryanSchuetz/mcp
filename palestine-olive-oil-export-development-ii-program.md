Agriculture contributes 27 percent of all Palestinian private sector output, making it a key sector for the economy. Olive oil production is of particular significance: olive trees comprise 45 percent of the total plant production in the West Bank and the annual income generated by olives and olive products is more than 20 percent of the overall national agricultural output. This project sought a demonstrative effect through supporting different players in the olive oil sector with the ultimate aim of increasing earnings across the value chain. The project framed its activities around three goals: improving access to strategic markets with growth opportunities; strengthening the supply chain and quality management of bottling companies; and strengthening the Palestinian Olive Oil Council (POOC).
