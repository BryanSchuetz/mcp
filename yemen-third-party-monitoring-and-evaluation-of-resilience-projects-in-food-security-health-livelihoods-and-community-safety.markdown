Decades of civil unrest have had a strong and long-term impact on Yemenis’ living and health conditions and the overall institutional and economic structures of the country. Yemen is considered by the United Nations to be experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.

Since the [2018 Stockholm agreement](https://osesgy.unmissions.org/stockholm-agreement), the European Union (EU) contributed to poverty reduction and development in the Republic of Yemen through cooperation assistance and the promotion of objectives related to environment and climate change, rights-based approach, social inclusion, and gender equality. 

With this project, DAI’s team of international and local consultants conducts monitoring and evaluation of EU projects covering food security, health, resilience, livelihoods, and community safety. 

### Sample Activities

* Perform eight evaluations and conduct third-party monitoring of 18 projects implemented by stakeholders such as CARE, UNICEF, UNESCO, FAO, EPOS, the Berhof Foundation, and the Danish Red Cross.
