DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) provided recommendations for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s National Industrial Development and Logistics Program implementation of local content key performance indicators and definition, to assure that local content was factored into program activities and achieves the goals set out in the Vision 2030. The team provided a thorough analysis of the relevant government’s department’s local content definition and calculation methodology, providing recommendations on the methodology and local content interventions. Risks were also identified in the process of setting targets for local content. In addition to recommendations, the project provided the client with a suite of tools, including local content scorecard templates to help optimize local content for major contract tenders.
