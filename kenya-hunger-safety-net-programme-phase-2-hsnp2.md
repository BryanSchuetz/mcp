The first phase of the Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP) in Kenya—from 2009 to 2012—reached 69,000 households in four northern counties with a cash transfer payment every two months. Phase 2 expanded coverage within the same four counties: Marsabit, Mandera, [Turkana](http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21657384-wild-ancient-and-oil-rich-turkana-shows-how-fast-continent-changing), and Wajir.

Households receiving the regular bi-monthly cash transfers were selected from the poorest 10 percent in each county, using a combination of Community-Based Targeting and Proxy Means Testing. A scalable emergency cash transfer response to droughts was built for 470,000 households, which were provided with bank accounts and cards in advance to facilitate rapid transfers.

The goal of [HSNP2](http://www.hsnp.or.ke/) was to continue to reduce poverty, hunger, and vulnerability in the focus counties, resulting in better and more sustainable [safety nets](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/strengthening-kenyas-hunger-safety-net-through-better-data-transfe/) for poor and [vulnerable households](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObSi7IXcYeU).

Through HSNP, more than 600,000 of Kenya’s most vulnerable people had access to cash transfers on a regular basis and up to 2.1 million people were reached with emergency cash transfers in times of drought or flood.

### Sample Activities

* Build capacity and sustainability of local partners.
* Implement framework for emergency scale-up.
* Agree with stakeholders to recertification process for cash transfers

### Select Results

* Activated the [HSNP Dashboard](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/strengthening-kenyas-hunger-safety-net-through-better-data-transfe?utm_source=daidotcom), allowing real-time data about cash transfers and the process to be transferred online to and from field-level staff, improving service.
* Reached 69,000 households in four northern counties with a cash transfer payment every two months in the first phase of HSNP in Kenya—from 2009 to 2012.
* Transitioned HSNP2 to be a Government of Kenya flagship programme. It expanded to register 374,000 households (more than 2.1 million people) across the four most arid and vulnerable counties.
* Close to 100,000 households are paid a regular transfer. HSNP has paid transfers to nearly 90,000 households from an early stage of the current extreme drought cycle, helping avoid damaging impact and losses occurring.
* Held up as a [case study](https://europa.eu/capacity4dev/articles/ground-long-road-social-protection-somalia) in “shock-responsive social protection,” contributing to evidence of cost-effectiveness of investments in resilience and planned intervention at early stage of a disaster compared to costly reactive “emergency” responses.
