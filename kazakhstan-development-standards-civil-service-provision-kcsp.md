Following Kazakhstan's independence in 1991, the government implemented a series of economic and political reforms, but by 2005 further improvements were still required to ensure continued progress. DAI worked with the government to develop performance standards and indicators for the civil service in pilot ministries and oblasts; the standards and indicators were later extended across the whole public administration. The project improved public service delivery, making it more responsive to the people, more efficient, and more economical.
