To more sustainably invest in the social and economic development of the communities where it operates in Ghana, Kosmos Energy sought the expertise of DAI in 2015 to offer new approaches to local engagement beyond traditional models of corporate social responsibility. Since then, DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) has been Kosmos Energy’s strategic advisor on social investments globally, supporting new market entry and growth of existing programs. In addition to the implementation of the Kosmos Innovation Center (KIC) in Ghana and Mauritania, SBG supports Kosmos at the global level in strategy, monitoring and evaluation, knowledge management, program design and analysis, and technical assistance.   

SBG has also analyzed new market entry strategies in several vastly different geographic locations, ranging from a small island nation to an advanced economy, to emerging markets. SBG taps into our deep institutional knowledge and local networks to map the entrepreneurial ecosystem; connect with key stakeholders in government, universities, private sector, and incubators; conduct multiple rounds of interviews; and incorporate data into detailed recommendations on local implementation. Using the SBG Partner Selection Framework, we assessed the approach, capacity, and key risks of various organizations and recommended a partnership approach in each country.
