Development programs targeting nutrition have been effective in gradually reducing the rate of stunting in Malawi. However, with one of the highest population growth rates in Africa, the country has not succeeded in reducing the number of stunted children.

The Technical Assistance to AFIKEPO Nutrition Programme was designed to help deliver the overall objective of the European Union’s [AFIKEPO Nutrition Programme](https://www.naosupportmw.org/programmes/nutrition-and-food-security/afikepo)—to enhance nutrition security in Malawi. The program aims to increase and diversify dietary intake of safe and nutritious foods to achieve optimal nutrition for women of childbearing age, adolescent girls, infants, and young children in 10 targeted districts. The project also aims to increase the use of enhanced nutrition knowledge, awareness, and hygiene practices, to strengthen multi-sectoral governance of nutrition and monitoring as well as informing national policies.

Our team supports the relevant line ministries, training institutions, and the targeted districts to appraise, plan, and implement qualitative activities, while maintaining a focus on good governance and support coordination and communication, and operational research.
