The Zambian aviation sector faces many technical, financial, and institutional capacity challenges. Nevertheless, air traffic in Zambia has grown strongly over the past 10 years, albeit from a low base. Based on current traffic and GDP projections, the Zambian aviation sector is set to expand significantly over the next decade. This growth would add extra demand on Zambia to implement the necessary safety and security oversight obligations, in line with requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 

Our project supports Zambia’s aviation sector—strengthening its policy, regulatory, and institutional capacities to improve compliance with international aviation standards, especially in terms of air safety and security oversight. 

Our assistance enhances the policy and legal environment in the aviation sector. It also includes a broad range of specialized training in critical aviation-related fields to enhance the necessary institutional capacities of key aviation stakeholders in Zambia.
