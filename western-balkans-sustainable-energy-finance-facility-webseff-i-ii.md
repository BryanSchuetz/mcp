Significant potential for sustainable energy investments remains untapped in the Western Balkans while improvement in sustainable energy still faces many barriers. WeBSEFF I and II continued the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's support to the region by providing debt financing to businesses, municipalities, and energy service companies for energy projects undertaken in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro, and Serbia. The goal: reduce energy intensity and promote diverse sources of green energy in a region where rising energy prices remain a challenge.

WeBSEFF I allocated €60 million to 131 projects in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Due to this success, a second phase of the project was launched in July 2013.

DAI was a partner to E3 International on both facilities and provided technical assistance in the implementation of dedicated credit lines, specifically assisting the participating financial institutions to on-lend the funds to qualified applicants.
