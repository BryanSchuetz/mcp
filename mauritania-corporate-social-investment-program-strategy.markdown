In West Africa, a 30-year multiphase project is forecasted to be a significant source of energy and revenue for both countries. The client is committed to a social investment programme delivering transformative impact to local and international stakeholders. To achieve this ambitious vision, the client requested DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) to create an innovative five-year strategy. This strategy delivered economic and social impact beyond project revenue, to create positive outcomes for government, commercial opportunities for suppliers, and direct employment. Within this strategy, the client was able to address major challenges in Mauritania and Senegal within the areas of education, health, environment, economic livelihoods, and access to energy.
