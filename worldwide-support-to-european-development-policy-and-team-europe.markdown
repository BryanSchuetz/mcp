Development cooperation is a key tool for supporting European Union (EU) partner countries to improve the lives of their citizens and achieve their development goals. For this purpose, the EU commits significant resources to contribute to the achievement of the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sdgs.un.org/2030agenda) and other key international commitments by overcoming challenges such as aid fragmentation and decrease in development effectiveness. 

The EU's new [Global Gateway](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/stronger-europe-world/global-gateway_en) aims to create smart, sustainable, and secure links with countries around the world in different thematic areas. The initiative is delivered through a [Team Europe](https://international-partnerships.ec.europa.eu/policies/team-europe-initiatives_en) approach, which brings together the EU and its member states with their financial and development institutions, including the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

Our project supports the European Commission’s headquarters, EU delegations, and partner countries to deliver the Global Gateway strategy. The project also supports EU efforts to achieve more effective development cooperation and support EU engagement within the [Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation](https://effectivecooperation.org/).

We will establish and operate a demand-driven technical assistance facility in close coordination with Directorate-General for International Partnerships and Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations. Our team will deliver a range of assignments in the fields of joint programming, Team Europe, Global Gateway, development effectiveness, development financing, and Sustainable Development Goals.
