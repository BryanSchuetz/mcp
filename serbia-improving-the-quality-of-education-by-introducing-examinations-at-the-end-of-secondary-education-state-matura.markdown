Analyses of the Serbian education system carried out in recent years have shown ample evidence of the need for improvement. The existing practice of the final examination system at the end of secondary education is not standardized; the assessment process is subjective and higher education institutions complain about the limited knowledge and low literacy of incoming students.

A new final examination system should resolve the existing problems and establish a coherent system linking educational goals, education standards, various forms of assessment, and evaluation. The standardized state-administered *matura*, at the end of secondary education across Serbia, enables the evaluation of the quality of education to become more objective.

The European Union-funded State Matura Project prepared the education system and the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development to implement the new final examination.
