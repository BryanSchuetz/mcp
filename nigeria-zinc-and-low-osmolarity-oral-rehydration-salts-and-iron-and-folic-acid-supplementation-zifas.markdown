The Zinc and Low-osmolarity Oral Rehydration Salts and Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation programme (ZIFAS) developed innovative strategies to improve upon the existing low coverage of low-osmolarity oral rehydration salts (L-ORS), zinc, and iron and folic acid supplements in four states in northern Nigeria.

ZIFAS increased the coverage and quality of antenatal care using low-dose IFAS to reduce pregnancy-related illnesses and deaths resulting from anaemia in pregnancy. Using a health system strengthening approach, ZIFAS ensured a long-term sustainable supply of ZIFAS in the public health system. The project team improved systems for forecasting and procurement as well as supply chain management, provided training for health managers and service providers, and strengthened government systems for monitoring and evaluation.
