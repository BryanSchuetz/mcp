DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) was hired by an international oil and gas company active in Senegal to develop a comprehensive approach to integrating local content into the company’s tendering process for major contracts. SBG experts worked with the client to establish an optimized approach to incorporating local content into contract tendering that balanced various drivers such as the need to incentivize local content, avoid cost escalation and preserve safety, quality and schedule. In addition to the hands-on advisory work, the SBG team developed a tailored set of documents: EOI Local Content Section; Local Content Terms and Conditions language; Local Content Plan Template for Scope of Work; Local Content Plan Exhibits (Bidder Tables); Local Content Plan Evaluation Matrix; and Local Content Performance Reporting Template. The documentation was fully integrated into the client’s set and the new process was deployed for all the major contract scopes for the offshore project.
