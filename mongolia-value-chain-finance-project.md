We devised a strategy to expand and improve financial services in Mongolia that would facilitate the strengthening of select value chains, including in mining, agriculture, construction, and manufacturing. The objective was to identify the key value chains and their main inefficiencies and vulnerabilities and propose forms of value chain financing that mitigate such weaknesses. A key aim of the feasibility study was to enable investors and stakeholders to ascertain investment opportunities in value chain finance.

### Select Results

* Identified inefficiencies and vulnerabilities within the value chains for the key industries in Mongolia.
* Proposed how these inefficiencies can be mitigated through value chain financing.
* Assessed the demand for value chain financing products.
* Illustrated multiple forms of loans, identifed key credit risks involved in value chain financing, and presented how such risks can be mitigated.
* Presented the comparative benefits of a value chain financing product over the existing financing available to small and medium-sized businesses.
