In recent years, energy consumption in Türkiye has grown rapidly, due to urbanization, positive demographic trends, economic growth, and increasing per capita income. But the country remains dependent on imported sources of energy, which can experience price fluctuations. Improving energy security is, therefore, one of Türkiye's top priorities. 

The [Technical Assistance Project for Establishment of Boosting Effective and Sustainable Transformation for Energy](https://www.bestforenergy.org/homepage) (BEST for Energy) increased the use of alternative energy sources, including renewable sources. The project also supported Türkiye's renewable energy industry and services to become more internationally competitive. 

BEST for Energy focused on the city of İzmir—and its vicinity—to ensure strong clustering in the renewable energy sector, which is essential to stimulating a long-term and self-sufficient enabling environment. The project contributed to İzmir’s regional renewable energy service and equipment industry cluster by increasing the competitiveness of its value chain, in line with the Competitiveness and Innovation Sector Operational Programme in Türkiye. 

The project developed a long-term competitiveness strategy and provided professional training in the clean energy sector. A significant accomplishment was the facilitation of a €343 million investment in solar panel production, leading to the creation of 2,500 job opportunities.
