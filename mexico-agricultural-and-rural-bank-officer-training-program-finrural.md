Through a U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) grant, DAI created and implemented a rural bank and credit officer training program to give Financiera Rural staff a solid foundation in rural and agricultural loan and credit operations, and to give the institution the in-house expertise it needed to meet its future demands for new officer training. The program had clear training and impact objectives—as well as built-in tools for assessing the impact of the training on both skill development and institutional performance—and made extensive use of participant exercises to reinforce the skills learned in the training sessions. The interactive, multimedia training and testing program was designed to be used as part of a trainer-led program or for independent study to reinforce knowledge learned during the initial training.
