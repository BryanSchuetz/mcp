Coordinating and integrating biodiversity conservation with other development efforts, where appropriate, can provide a powerful opportunity to address the multifaceted challenges people face to add value and produce longer-lasting development outcomes.

The Integrated Natural Resource Management (INRM) Activity provided technical assistance, facilitation, adaptive management, and innovative tools and approaches to help USAID drive the uptake and operationalization of its Environmental and Natural Resource Management (ENRM) Framework in five areas:

* Assisting missions with the analysis and development of an evidence base to support integrated ENRM programming;
* Supporting and facilitating the design and adaptive management of ENRM programming;
* Testing innovative approaches for integrated ENRM programming;
* Supporting monitoring, evaluation, and learning for integrated programming; and
* Supporting communications and knowledge management initiatives for integrated programming.

Partner subcontractors included Social Impact, New America, The Center for Biodiversity and Conservation at the American Museum of Natural History, the University of Rhode Island Coastal Resource Centre, Resource Equity, Conservation Strategy Fund, and Stantec.
