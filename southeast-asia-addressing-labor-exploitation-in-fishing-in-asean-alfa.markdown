Collectively, the 10 countries that comprise the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) contribute more than 20 percent of global fish production. In 2022, six out of 10 ASEAN member states were listed among the top 25 countries for [marine capture fisheries](https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/66538eba-9c85-4504-8438-c1cf0a0a3903/content/sofia/2024/capture-fisheries-production.html#note-1_f).

The fishing industry and seafood supply chains play major roles in ASEAN economies, including the region’s gross domestic product and millions of employment opportunities. As the region’s fishing industry continues to thrive, it has created repercussions on illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and exploitative and abusive treatment of workers to proliferate, including treatment that rises to the level of forced labor and human trafficking. However, oversight has not kept pace, and a policy gap still exists.

Partnered with the U.S. Department of Labor, the Addressing Labor Exploitation in Fishing in ASEAN (ALFA) project supports regional governments in building the capacity to coordinate and collaborate across its members to mitigate forced labor and promote responsible labor practices in the fishing industry.
