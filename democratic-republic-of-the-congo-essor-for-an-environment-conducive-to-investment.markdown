The five-year Essor Programme was launched by a consortium headed by Pricewaterhouse. Essor acted at meso (business associations) and macro (government) levels to improve the incomes of the poor through the development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs)—including those that are women- and youth-owned and those in rural areas—through reforms to the country’s investment climate and policies.

Essor’s workstreams focused on:

1. Implementing the Organisation of the Harmonisation of the Business Law in Africa (OHADA), an initiative that comprises 17 countries, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC);
2. Combatting corruption;
3. Improving access to electricity at the provincial level; and
4. Expanding access to finance (Essor A2F), the workstream implemented by DAI.
