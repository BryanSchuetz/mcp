The Nigerian government recognizes the devastating effects of changes in climate on socio-economic development. However, poor governance and stakeholder engagement hinder resilience efforts despite growing awareness about impacts of extreme weather-related events. Effective collective action for managing these impacts and developing resilience remains elusive.

The Partnership for Agile Governance & Climate Engagement (PACE) project supports coalitions that influence governments to resolve climate and governance problems affecting the poorest and most vulnerable communities. It aims to increase state government income from internally generated revenue, mainstream climate action in state government policy, planning, and budgets, and strengthen election delivery and credibility. The program is implemented in Kaduna, Kano, and Jigawa in north-western Nigeria, with targeted strategic engagement at the federal and regional levels.

PACE builds on the successes of predecessor projects—such as [Accountable, Responsive, and Capable Government (ARC)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/nigeria-accountable-responsive-and-capable-government-ARC) and [State Partnership for Accountability, Responsiveness, and Capability (SPARC)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/nigeria-state-partnership-for-accountability-responsiveness-and-capability)—which have underpinned governance reform in Nigeria for more than 20 years.

The program treats changes to climate as a political and governance issue. It facilitates new coalitions to address governance barriers, providing targeted, politically informed assistance to strengthen government systems and support citizen empowerment and accountability.

PACE supports the development and implementation of effective governance and climate strategies. This includes embedding, deepening, and broadening reform efforts in partner states and at the federal level to influence change throughout all 36 Nigerian states. It aims to establish communities of practice for Commissioners of Planning and Budget from all states and for senior women in civil or public service.
