The IKEA Foundation is one of the world’s largest private funders committed to helping refugees achieve economic self-reliance and sustainable livelihoods.

The Sustainable Market Inclusive Livelihood Pathways to Self-Reliance program (SMILES) seeks to address rural refugee livelihood challenges in Uganda. SMILES aims to help ultra-poor refugee and Ugandan (host community) households in the Kikuube and Kyegegwa Districts graduate from food insecurity and fragile livelihoods to self-reliance and resilience.

The project combines a graduation approach, led by AVSI, and a market systems development (MSD) approach, led by DAI in partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), REPARLE, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), and the University of Makerere.

## Sample Activities

* Conduct women, youth, weather-related risk, and market systems assessments in target refugee areas.
* Partner with national agri-input suppliers and buyers to expand the commercial potential of refugee and host community farmers in value chains such as maize, beans, and horticulture.
* Incentivize fintech providers to use digital platforms to partner with local refugee-led Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations (SACCOs).
* Build last-mile distribution networks with clean energy enterprises to expand solar pay-as-you-go business models to expand refugee livelihoods activities (such as household lighting, solar-powered irrigation, and affordable power to run a fridge in their microenterprises).
* Design randomized control trials to test new models for integrating the graduation and MSD approaches.
