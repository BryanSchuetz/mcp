DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) completed a rapid desktop benchmarking study comparing social investment spend and initiatives across seven major oil and gas companies in Oman. The study was completed on behalf of an international oil and gas company looking to inform its five-year social investment strategy planning process. The study looked at corporate social investment terminology, structure of funds, level of spend globally and nationally, number of initiatives, and initiative themes. The team differentiated between social investment spend, sponsorship spend, and foundation spend to accurately compare investments.
