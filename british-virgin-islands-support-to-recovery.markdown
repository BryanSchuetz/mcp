The hurricanes of 2017 devastated the infrastructure of the British Virgin Islands. More than one-third of residential buildings suffered significant damage while crippled maritime facilities hindered economic recovery. To achieve the government’s long-term plan of building back better, stronger, and greener, the local labour force requires new skills and building and labour regulations need revising.

### Sample Activities

* Partner with a local community college to develop training materials and provide external trainers for courses on electrical, plumbing, and project management skills.
* Engage with the private and public sector to secure commitments for apprenticeships and employment for trainees.
* Advise on regulations to boost resilience in housing codes and on labour market policies to maximise recovery efforts.

### Select Results
