To meet the objective of being an industry thought-leader in local content, Shell’s Local Content Centre of Excellence holds a yearly event called Global Connect. The event brings together local content practitioners from dozens of Shell operations worldwide to exchange experiences, develop approaches, and network. To enhance the impact of the event, Shell invited DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) local content experts Zachary Kaplan and [Dorival Bettencourt](https://www.dai.com/who-we-are/our-team/dorival-bettencourt) to deliver two local content modules on the last day of the event. The training was comprised of modules that focused on local content planning and engagement approach and local content plan design and implementation.
