regions: Latin America and the Caribbean
country: Paraguay


Paraguay faces one of the highest rates of forest loss in Latin America, with ecosystems increasingly under pressure due to wildfires, a lack of conservation capacity, illegal logging, and charcoal production. The country's economy, reliant on extensive use of natural resources such as land for agribusiness and livestock, and water for hydroelectric production, has rendered it vulnerable to changes in climate.

Our project works to preserve and restore biodiversity by combating deforestation and promoting sustainable forest management. Aligned with European Union policy priorities such as the European Green Deal and the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, it aids Paraguay in meeting its Paris Agreement commitments.

The project focuses on improving preparedness, prevention, and capacities to reduce the incidence and spread of extreme forest fires, strengthening the management and conservation of forests and other key ecosystems in three selected protected areas, and promoting sustainable forestry, livestock, and agriculture practices, along with their respective value chains in buffer zones and areas of influence around the selected areas.
