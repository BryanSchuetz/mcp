DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) was contracted by the Niger Delta Partnership Initiative (NDPI) to conduct a workforce assessment and develop a program design for the program Identifying Pathways to Employment for Youth in the Niger Delta. For the first phase of this project, SBG conducted an extensive review of research on youth unemployment in the Niger Delta and youth employment initiatives historically and presently in the region. SBG also analyzed the current state of the labor market in Nigeria and specifically the three target states—Rivers, Abia, and Akwa Ibom. The study focused on four priority sectors noted for having high potential for youth employment opportunities: agriculture, information and communications technology, construction, and renewable and solar energy. SBG developed this research and analysis into a report presented to NDPI and stakeholders to inform the program design. 

During the second phase, SBG worked with project stakeholders to design a comprehensive, fit-for-purpose youth employment program spanning the three Niger Delta states and priority sectors.
