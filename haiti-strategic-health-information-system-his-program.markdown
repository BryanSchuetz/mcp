The Haiti Strategic Health Information System (HIS) Program team consolidated and integrated Haiti’s disconnected health information assets—[empowering](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-to-launch-usaid-health-information-system-program-in-haiti) the national *System d’Information Sanitaire Nationale Unique* (SISNU).

At present, Haiti’s digital and paper-based health reporting platforms vary greatly from city to city and village to village. This makes Haiti highly vulnerable from a health security standpoint, especially considering its challenging history of devastating earthquakes, hurricanes, and contagious diseases, including the 2010 cholera outbreak. By creating a single, comprehensive health information system, Haiti will now be better prepared to address its inevitable health crises as well as the [daily needs](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/health-system-in-haiti-takes-key-step-by-launching-national-tuberculosis-tracker) of its 11 million people. This benefits not just Haiti but its donor partners and the entire Caribbean region.

### Sample Activities

* Enhance departmental coordination for data collection, consolidation, and reporting.
* Support SISNU implementation, training, and enhancements, including by setting up a help desk to support users.
* Develop SISNU stewardship by supporting Haiti’s Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Population (health ministry) with skills assessment and training, and dashboards, and a web portal that support data analysis and information dissemination.
* Increase interoperability between SISNU and stakeholders such as local health providers and clinics.
* Engage private sector partners in computer infrastructure and private hospitals.
* Establish technical working groups.
* Work with the health ministry to update policy and framework for data standardization, exchange, privacy, and security; interoperability of systems; and unique patient identifiers across health systems.

### Select Results

* Assisted the Government of Haiti to enroll and monitor [37,491 tuberculosis patients](https://www.dai.com/news/haiti-marks-world-tb-day-by-closing-in-on-30-000-patients-enrolled-and-monitored) less than one year after it launched the country's tuberculosis tracker. As of January 2020, the number enrolled is more than 41,000.
* Digitized previously paperbound patient details registered by healthcare providers at local facilities across Haiti.
* Created a mobile application to facilitate increased data collection, including from rural locales.
