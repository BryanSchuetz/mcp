Sierra Leone has ranked near the bottom of the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Index for some time. Like other areas of public administration, the Office of the Auditor General was weakened by the civil war, lack of resources, and deterioration of government accountability systems. Weak financial management and information systems, shortages of qualified staff, and a weakened Parliament constrained the office's ability to act as an independent assessor of government financial activities. In consortium with PKF LLP, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, and the Swedish Institute for Public Administration, DAI improved the quality, quantity, and impact of public sector auditing through support to the Auditor General's Office, the Public Accounts Committee, civil society groups, and the media.
