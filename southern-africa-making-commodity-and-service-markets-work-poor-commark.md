ComMark was designed specifically to facilitate the development and improved operation of commodity and service markets for the benefit of poor people in Southern Africa. This project focused on growing sub-sectors within and across countries with high growth potential, including South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland, as well as fostering broader regional linkages.

###  Sample Activities

* Facilitate and incentivize the efficient operation of institutions, processes and practice which have a direct bearing on pro-poor market growth.

###  Select Results

* Improved legal and regulatory frameworks in specific commodity and service sectors.
* Investigated and overcame barriers to entry for merging farmers and small businesses.
* Facilitated business linkages between large and small enterprises, many of the latter being from previously disadvantaged communities.
* Enabled the establishment of commercial public-private partnerships.
