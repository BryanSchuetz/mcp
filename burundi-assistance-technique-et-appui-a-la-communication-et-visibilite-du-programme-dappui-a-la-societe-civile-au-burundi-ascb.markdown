Since 2005, Burundi’s public policies around decentralization have called for civil society to participate in local governance—particularly in the preparation, implementation, and monitoring of municipal community development five-year plans.

Implemented through grants and procurement of services, the ASCB project supports civil organizations’ participation in development and local governance issues. 

DAI’s team advises and supports ASBC’s implementing partners through technical assistance focused on methodology, tools for monitoring and evaluation, capitalization, and capacity building for grassroots organizations.
