The sustainable, inclusive economic growth foreseen by [Egypt Vision 2030](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt_Vision_2030) will depend on the ability of Egypt’s private enterprises to grow, create jobs, and adapt to market changes without donor support. Egypt’s private sector can recover successfully from pandemic-inflicted economic damage and make major strides toward sustainable growth with support from the U.S. Agency for International Development’s Business Egypt activity.

Business Egypt is building a robust ecosystem of market-led institutions—incubators, accelerators, business service providers, financial institutions, youth and women’s networks, business associations, public-private forums, one-stop shops—working in harmony to create long-term jobs, and a more resilient private sector. Business Egypt aims to substantially increase sales revenues and investments among Egyptian micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), thereby creating new job opportunities, especially for women and youth. The result will be the creation of thousands of new jobs, particularly in our proposed value chains: solar power, processed fruits and vegetables, information technology services, ready-made garments, and automotive supply.

DAI’s implementation approach makes maximum use of Egyptian resources. The bulk of technical implementation will be carried out by our three Egyptian partners—Acumen Consulting, N Gage Consulting, and the American University of Cairo Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation—while DAI will provide technical direction, management, capacity building, and information systems support.
