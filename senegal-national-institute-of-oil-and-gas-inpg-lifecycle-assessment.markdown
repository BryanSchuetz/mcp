In July 2019, DAI’s Sustainable Business Group was selected to develop a 10-year Operational Business Plan for Senegal’s recently created Institut National du Pétrole et du Gaz (INPG). The team worked with INPG as well as key public and private stakeholders to develop an ambitious but feasible, effective, and comprehensive multiphase strategic plan. This plan will help sustainably accomplish INPG’s goal of shaping and training the future leaders of the oil and gas industry while creating a workforce that can compete on a global scale. 
 
The desktop research, in-country data collection, and expert interviews coupled with the team’s global experience allowed for: 

* In-depth analysis of the current and anticipated dynamics and human resource needs of Senegal’s and neighboring country’s nascent oil and gas industry; 
* Thorough understanding of the competitive landscape with a focus on the capacity, potential, challenges, and needs in the local educational and training environment; and
* Compilation of applicable insights on the backgrounds, business models, organizational structures, facilities, and funding mechanisms of international educational and training institutions with similar goals than INPG. 
 
These activities led to the definition of the following key elements of INPG’s business model: 

* Guiding principles centered on training needs, national priorities, skill levels of the workforce, local supply chains, and quality of services; 
* Key client segments composed of governmental entities, Senegalese workforce, oil and gas companies, educational institutions, national private sector, civil society, and foreign governments;  
* Major service areas consisting of degree programs, certifications, capacity building programs, and information events and activities; and
* Preliminary key performance indicators with success factors targeting local economic development, workforce capacity, teaching quality, and organizational efficiency.
