Türkiye is a country with two sea borders, sitting between eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East. It lies at a crossroads for inter-regional and intercontinental migration. Within the last decade, the civil unrest in the Middle East particularly destabilized the region, with the domino effect of uprisings leading to conflict and civil war, in turn leading to significant migration flows out of the region. Managing migration both into and through its borders is a pressing issue for Türkiye.

Our project improved Türkiye’s legal and administrative framework in migration management by establishing a well-functioning migration management system in line with the European Union (EU) acquis and standards. The objective was to improve the institutional capacity of the Turkish Directorate General of Migration Management (DGMM) for nationality identification through piloting a Language Analysis System (LAS).

The development, implementation, and evaluation of the LAS pilot—allied with targeted capacity building and the establishment of a range of policy dialogue mechanisms—will enable the process of nationality determination of irregular migrants in Türkiye. 

This intervention was a critical element towards strengthening the migration management system in Türkiye.
