Our principal responsibility under this subcontract was to strengthen the governance capacity and accountability mechanisms of partner country health systems.

This project under the U.S. Agency for International Development's new Office of Health Systems supported partner countries' efforts to increase domestic resources available for health care, manage those resources more effectively and accountably, and increase the responsiveness of health systems to their populations' needs, especially women, girls, and poor and rural populations.

In addition to prime contractor Abt Associates, other partners included Training Resources Group, Inc., Broad Branch Associates, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Results for Development Institute (R4D), and Avenir Health.

### Sample Activities

* Support the supply and demand in partner countries for good governance of health systems.
* Build upon successful efforts in Jordan to improve systems for health budgeting, in Bangladesh on civil society oversight of health facilities, and [in El Salvador][1] on local revenue generation.
