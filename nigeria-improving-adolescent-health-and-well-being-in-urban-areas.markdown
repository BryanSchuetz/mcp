In Nigeria, the growing urban youth population includes an increasingly marginalized segment—adolescents who are out-of-school, unmarried, married, or underprivileged, facing more barriers in accessing accurate, reliable health information as traditional programs have struggled to reach them or meet their needs.

The U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Youth-Powered Ecosystem to Advance Urban Adolescent Health activity [empowered](https://www.usaid.gov/nigeria/press-releases/usaid-takes-novel-approach-improving-adolescent-health) young people with skills, social capital, and resources needed to realize their full potential. The program improved adolescent health by increasing access to relevant services within a broader, more holistic context of youth empowerment, coupled with a deeper understanding of the challenges that adolescents face.

The project reached more than 300,000 adolescents through various interventions across the TEENSMATA Youth Hubs that served as safe spaces for adolescents. The project fostered a sense of ownership and agency through the active involvement of the target demographic and in turn, empowering more than 67,000 adolescents with life skills.
