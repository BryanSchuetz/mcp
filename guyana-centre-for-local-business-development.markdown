The [Centre for Local Business Development](https://www.dai.com/news/dai-to-collaborate-with-exxonmobil-on-centre-for-local-business-development-in-guyana) in Guyana was established in 2017 with the objective to assist local businesses to become more competitive and to support their entry into the nascent oil and gas supply chain. The Centre became Guyana’s leading source for local oil and gas procurement, business and industry information, policy advocacy and professional networking opportunities. It provides reliable, up-to-date information on the offshore oil and gas sector, in addition to training and mentorship for business.  

The Centre’s activities focus on supplier engagement and registration, general business support, and supplier development. Engagement and registration focus on allowing businesses to garner the necessary information to make strategic investment decisions. General business support aims to build a pool of businesses to international standards. Supplier development utilizes mentoring programs to enable businesses to make the transition into the oil and gas supply chain and potentially win work.
