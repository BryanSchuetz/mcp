Société Générale Expressbank (SGE), one of Bulgaria's leading banks in the consumer finance market, was interested in expanding its small and medium enterprise (SME) loan portfolio. To this end, SGE introduced tailored SME products, restructured its dedicated SME department, and concentrated efforts on attracting its target group of comparatively large SME customers with transparent financials. DAI was contracted by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to assist SGE in this transition period by reviewing and suggesting improvements to: SME lending process flow and methodology; risk management practice, including credit scoring; and SME loan product offerings.
