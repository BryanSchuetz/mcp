By March 2009, the Reconversion and Development Bank (RDB) had become the 18th largest bank in Belarus in terms of total assets. With a focus on retail lending, the bank was one of the most profitable in the country and wanted to grow its micro and small business portfolio to become a more universal bank. DAI led a consortium that provided technical assistance in parallel to an equity investment by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in RDB of $3.36 million in 2008, followed by a further increase in 2010. EBRD's support to RDB emphasized the need to increase access to financial services in the country from a privately owned financial institution and particularly for micro, small, and medium enterprises through improving vital business processes at the bank.
