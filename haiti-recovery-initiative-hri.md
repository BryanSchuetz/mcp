The January 2010 earthquake shattered Haiti's teeming capital of Port-au-Prince, killing and maiming hundreds of thousands of people, rendering homeless hundreds of thousands more, and leaving the city in ruins with miles of buildings and homes collapsed and infrastructure broken. [HRI worked][1] in Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien to stabilize communities through short-term, local interventions; supported the Government of Haiti by providing equipment and technical assistance; and increased citizen engagement through swift and accurate information dissemination.
