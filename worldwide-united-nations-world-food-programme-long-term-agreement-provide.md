Volatile food prices, changing weather patterns, and local and regional instability are contributing to increased numbers of refugees, internally displaced people, and food-insecure communities. In a food security crisis, many of these people and communities depend on the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) for assistance. DAI performed evaluations of WFP's portfolio of programs in Central America, Chad, Haiti, Yemen, Zimbabwe, and Niger to help the organization better implement its food assistance programs.
