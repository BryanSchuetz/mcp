While Mozambique’s economy is emerging—notably through the extractives sector—most Mozambicans remain very poor. Financial Sector Deepening Mozambique (FSDMoç) was a facility to [develop](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/qa-assisting-mozambiques-rural-poor-to-build-stability-and-economic-opportunity-through-digital-financial-inclusion?utm_source=daidotcom) the country’s financial sector by expanding financial inclusion, which would help build local prosperity and economic resilience. FSDMoç aimed to create access to basic financial services for 2.6 million individuals and 1,000 businesses in Mozambique by 2019, targeting women, youth, and the rural poor as well as small and growing businesses that lacked access to appropriate and accessible financial services.

In July 2017, [FSDMoç](http://fsdmoc.com/) received an additional 39 million Swedish Krona (£3.5 million) from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. These additional funds enabled FSDMoç to adapt to emerging opportunities in the digital finance, inclusive insurance, and housing finance sectors.
