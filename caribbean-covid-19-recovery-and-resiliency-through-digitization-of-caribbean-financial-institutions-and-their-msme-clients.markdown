DAI is working to increase the adoption of digital innovations that promote business resilience and enhance productivity among financial institutions in the Caribbean—notably Barbados, Belize, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago—and their micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) clients. The focus is on facilitating access to financial technology  (FinTech) and other digital solutions, largely by creating pathways for adoption in collaboration with local incubators, accelerators, innovation hubs, and FinTech businesses.

This project builds on the DAI Sustainable Business Group’s partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and expands DAI’s IDB portfolio in the region to five projects. This program is hosted by the IDB Lab, the IDB’s innovation center, leveraging funding from the Canada Cooperation Framework.

### Sample Activities

* Upgrade financial institutions’ internal business operations and client services through digitalization and online banking solutions.
* Facilitate access of MSME customers to a wider ecosystem of fit-for-purpose solutions and financial technology, such as eCommerce, online inventory management, and digital marketing.
