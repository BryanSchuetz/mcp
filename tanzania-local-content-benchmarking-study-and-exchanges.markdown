DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) was contracted by the Oil and Gas Association of Tanzania (OGAT) to complete a Local Content Benchmarking Study and subsequent Local Content Advisory. This analysis provided a discussion on the key elements of a robust local content framework and developed six ways to categorize different aspects of a local content legal framework. The study explained each and then used this framework to assess how Tanzania’s local content framework (mainly the Petroleum Act 2015) mapped against these. The study then looked at the local content policy experience in Angola, Brazil, Ghana, Mozambique, and Nigeria against this same framework to provide data points on a variety of approaches to local content development. 

Phase II directly built off of the insights and relationships established during the Local Content Benchmarking Study (LCBS). In consultation with OGAT, and using the findings from the LCBS, SBG produced a series of local content topic-specific briefs. The briefs provided concise, pointed analysis of specific local content topics to facilitate focused discussion around key “hot button” issue areas. SBG also arranged numerous bilateral meetings to develop an in-depth understanding of stakeholder’s perspectives. Following the culmination of the topic briefs and bilateral engagement sessions, SBG conducted Local Content Exchanges that were topic-specific discussions and information exchanges that provided participants the opportunity to set actionable next steps for the drafting of the regulations. Finally, SBG produced a white paper summarizing the key findings and recommendations that were established throughout the advisory process with the Government of Tanzania.
