Albania’s strategic priority is European Union (EU) integration. Following the 2022 Inter-Governmental Conference, Albania is committed to advancing its EU accession. This project strengthens Albania’s institutional capacity to manage EU negotiations and align with the [Growth Plan for the Western Balkans](https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/enlargement-policy/growth-plan-western-balkans_en).

The EUIS facility strengthens Albania’s institutional capacity to manage EU negotiations and support the implementation of the Growth Plan, thereby accelerating integration. With eight interconnected Output Areas, it will enhance key structures such as the Chief Negotiator and Negotiation Team, the Secretariat for EU Integration, and line ministries and agencies, working in part through Inter-Institutional Working Group mechanisms.

The initiative focuses on advancing Albania’s approximation process by meeting [National Plan for European Integration](https://integrimi-ne-be.punetejashtme.gov.al/en/anetaresimi-ne-be/plani-kombetar-i-integrimit-pkie/) targets, fulfilling related benchmarks, and achieving the 2030 technical integration goal. It will support accession negotiations, facilitate Cluster negotiations, and maximize accelerated integration opportunities to ensure effective implementation of the Growth Plan.
