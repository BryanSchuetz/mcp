The Middle East and North Africa Enterprise Survey findings from 2016 show that Egyptian small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are largely excluded from the banking system. Egyptians themselves like to describe their economy as a cash economy, with evidence that only 6 percent of SMEs in Egypt have a bank loan outstanding, compared to 38 percent in the other countries of the Southern Neighbourhood. The small footprint of the banking system reflects both weak demand for and limited supply of loans. In Egypt, complex application procedures, unfavourable interest rates, strict collateral requirements, and a likely rejection discourage applicants from even applying, more so than in other countries of the Southern Neighbourhood.

In this context, the European Investment Bank (EIB) sought to expand sustainable lending to SMEs in Egypt, thus contributing to the broadening and deepening of the financial sector, supporting SMEs, and promoting the development of the private sector, as well as creating and securing employment and income in strategic sectors of Egypt.

DAI’s technical assistance increased access to capital and financial resources for underserved groups of SMEs by working with the Bank of Alexandria (AlexBank) in enhancing understanding of the issues specific to SME lending, introducing the best lending and advisory practices, helping to design and roll out the programme that includes nonfinancial services aiming to improve financial literacy among final beneficiaries.
