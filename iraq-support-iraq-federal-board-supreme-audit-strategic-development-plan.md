As Iraq's primary audit institution, the Federal Board of Supreme Audit (FBSA) plays an integral role in ensuring the accountability of public funds, government institutions, and public servants. The board's strategic plan provides a roadmap for institutional strengthening to help the FBSA fulfill this mandate.

DAI managed this grant, implemented by a team of expert advisors in financial and performance audit, petroleum accounting, fraud detection and prevention, and institutional relationship strengthening.

### Sample Activities

* Provide in-depth training on performance audit and risk management across three different types of state-owned industries: financial; for-profit; and service.
