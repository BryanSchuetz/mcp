A public sector client in the Middle East commissioned DAI to assess the economic impact – including local content opportunities – of a national energy transition from fossil fuels toward clean hydrogen-based solutions.

The study demonstrated the total economic impact of the client’s transition to clean hydrogen energy use by 2040, assuming the presence of a global carbon tax. It consisted of a computable general equilibrium (CGE) analysis and a high-level supply chain and local content analysis. The CGE provided scenario-based economic estimates of real economic impact and quantified the value of societal benefits due to emission abatements. The supply chain and local content analysis yielded a high-level understanding of the likely local content opportunities within high-value supply chains. Outputs from the assessment have been incorporated into a larger ongoing pre-feasibility study.
