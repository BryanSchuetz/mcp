The U.K. Nigeria Infrastructure Advisory Facility (UKNIAF) enhances the management of Nigeria’s infrastructure development towards power sector reform, public-private partnerships (PPP), capital spending, and repair and maintenance of federal roads. This work is expected to result in increased economic growth, job creation, and contribute towards the United Nations' Global Goals by reducing poverty for the majority of the Nigeria populace.

Designed to be flexible and demand-driven, UKNIAF consults with government ministries and agencies that plan and deliver infrastructure or develop mechanisms or transactions involving private sector financing of infrastructure. The project’s technical assistance focuses on the power sector, federal roads, and infrastructure finance. As a subcontractor to TetraTech, DAI contributes mainly to the infrastructure finance component, along with some crosscutting inputs across the project.

### Sample Activities

* Complete Nigeria's power sector reforms, leading to a contract-based market, privatisation of National Integrated Power Project plants, and a successful concession of the Transmission Company of Nigeria.
* Improve the way public money is spent on the Federal Road Network, with a reformed Federal Road Maintenance Agency using a UKNIAF-developed Road Asset Management System to prioritise investments and strengthen budgeting and project management capability.
* Increase capacity within government to develop PPPs; improve processes for screening capital projects in line with post-COVID priorities, and improve access to financing for infrastructure project preparation.
