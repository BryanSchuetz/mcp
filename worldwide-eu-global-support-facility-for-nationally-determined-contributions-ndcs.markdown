Climate action—including achieving climate neutrality and enhancing resilience—is at the heart of the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement), [2030 Agenda](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-action/), and the [European Green Deal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en). As part of the Paris Agreement, all parties communicate new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) every five years, outlining climate actions they have taken. Developing countries are in particular need of support in implementing and updating their own NDCs.

DAI is setting up and operating the EU Global Support Facility for Nationally Determined Contributions to contribute to the transition towards low-carbon, resource-efficient, and resilient economies in line with the Green Deal, Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction, and the Sustainable Development Goals. The facility's purpose is to deliver high-level technical assistance and policy advice to support the design, update, and implementation of EU partner countries' NDCs, long-term strategies, and national adaptation plans.
