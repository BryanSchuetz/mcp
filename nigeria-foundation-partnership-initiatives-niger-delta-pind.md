DAI assisted the Chevron Corporation with the [strategic design ](https://www.devex.com/en/news/chevron/81078)of the Foundation for Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta (PIND), a Nigerian-registered [foundation,](https://www.devex.com/en/news/beyond-philanthropy-what-happens-when-a/82220) by helping outline a strategy for its economic development program, specifically orienting its activities around a market systems approach and developing monitoring and evaluating mechanisms to document their impact. Collectively, these recommendations informed the principles of intervention, program areas, sustainable outcomes, and intermediate and final impacts of the Foundation's 2011–2014 Strategic Plan. DAI also identified resources to execute the economic development component of the plan, and established criteria for prioritizing projects and selecting implementing partners.

### Sample Activities

* Assure [PIND](http://www.inclusivebusinesshub.org/facilitating-market-led-inclusive-agribusiness-investment/)'s plan coheres with and integrates into its broader social and business objectives.
* Provide long-term technical assistance and capacity building expertise to help implement the strategic plan and operationalize the Economic Development Centre into a sustainable local institution.

* Supervise implementation of five value chain studies by local partners.
* Help [PIND](https://beamexchange.org/practice/programme-index/237/) plan and refine program activities targeting systemic value chain development programs, infrastructure projects designed to create sustainable employment through building the capacity of local firms to provide high labor intensity contracting, and business linkage programs to enhance the ability of local firms to supply goods and services to international oil companies.

### Select Results
