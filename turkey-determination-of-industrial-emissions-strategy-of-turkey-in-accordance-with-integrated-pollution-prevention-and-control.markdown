Türkiye’s economic and social development performance since 2000 has been impressive, leading to increased employment and incomes and making it one of the largest middle-income countries. Türkiye’s economy is mainly dominated by industry and services sectors, while the agriculture sector is smaller. The automotive, petrochemical, and electronics industries have risen in importance and surpassed the traditional textiles and clothing sectors within Türkiye’s export mix. 

On the other hand, Türkiye’s economic growth has been accompanied by a significant rise in pollutants, energy use, water consumption, and waste accumulation. The country’s economic growth has also changed consumption and production patterns, caused environmental degradation, and increased inequalities, which has been exacerbated by the increasing population and urbanisation levels. Reflecting rapid sectoral growth in energy, industry, transport, and tourism, industrial pollution problems are now one of the leading environmental issues in Türkiye. 

Given that Türkiye has a growing interest to control and prevent industrial pollution, which has profound economic and social implications in the country, [our project](https://ippc.csb.gov.tr/en) played a significant role in ensuring effective industrial pollution control. Our team supported Türkiye in its efforts to establish industrial pollution prevention and control approaches, according to the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED), as well as built institutional and technical capacity while raising awareness concerning air pollution issues. It promoted environmentally friendly industrial production and contributed to policy development, leading to a Draft National Action Plan for Determining Türkiye's Emission Strategy that serves as a roadmap for a green transition and zero pollution by 2053.

## Sample Activities

* Protect human health and the environment by integrated management of industrial pollution through the implementation of the IED.
* Increase the technical and institutional capacity of the relevant authorities for effective implementation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) approach in Türkiye in line with the European Union's IED.
* Develop technical capacity and substructure for the implementation of IPPC approach.
* Develop institutional capacity and increase awareness.

## Select Results

* Organised 17 workshops to support the harmonization of the national legislation with EU Directives on Industrial Emissions and Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control.
* Held three training of trainer sessions for civil servants from the Ministry of Environment, Urbanisation, and Climate. 
* Facilitated a green transformation awareness seminar for the Ministry of Environment, Urbanisation, and Climate for 800 people.
* Carried out study visits to Italy and France for project stakeholders to build their understanding of the application of the IED in EU countries.
* Developed certification software to detect industrial emissions in Türkiye. 
* Produced a project website and video to showcase the progress of the project.
