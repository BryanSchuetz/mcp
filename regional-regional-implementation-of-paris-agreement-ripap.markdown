Climate change is a global challenge that requires a collaborative response. With the recently concluded Paris Agreement, there is an increasing demand for international cooperation to drive the necessary transformation to a more resilient, low-carbon economy. The European Union (EU) has been implementing ambitious climate policy for decades and has accumulated extensive knowledge to be shared with experts and policymakers in the beneficiary countries. 

Our project contributed to climate change mitigation and adaptation and the development of a resource-efficient, low-emissions, and climate-resilient economy in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, and Türkiye.
 
We helped the countries implement the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and low-emissions development strategies. Additionally, the project enabled regional cooperation through the exchange of information, best practices, experience, and awareness-raising.
