The global Climate Finance Accelerator (CFA) program is a four-year technical assistance program funded by the U.K. Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and contracted by PricewaterhouseCoopers. DAI, as a subcontractor, is delivering the first two phases of the CFA activities in Pakistan by convening a wide variety of stakeholders, including project proponents and developers, banks and other finance providers, and government representatives.

## Sample Activities

* Formulate a report mapping the climate finance ecosystem in Pakistan and outlining the key gaps that are a barrier to a fully functioning supply chain.
* [Launch a call for proposals](https://cfapakistan.com/) to identify low-carbon projects relevant to the interest of investors. The projects should also deliver co-benefits such as poverty reduction, improved women's economic empowerment, and resilience to climate impacts. 
* Develop a shortlist of eight to 10 potentially low-carbon projects. 
* Build the capacity of project proponents to ensure they can productively engage with financial experts at events convened to connect projects with capital market players.
* Develop knowledge products, including an in-country event summary report, final outline term sheets prepared by participants, and a summary of identified recommended changes to the policy environment.

## Select Results

* Seven innovative low-carbon projects from across Pakistan have been selected from over 50 applications for the first cohort. The projects are from the energy, transportation, AFOLU (agriculture, forestry, and other land use), waste, e-mobility, and industrial and manufacturing sectors.
* Selected projects also have the potential to benefit communities through pollution abatement, employment opportunities, access to energy, effective waste management, and e-mobility.
* Support for the projects includes individual needs assessment discussions and analysis of each of the projects from a financial, technical, women's empowerment, and social inclusion perspective to ensure they are in the best position to attract investment.
