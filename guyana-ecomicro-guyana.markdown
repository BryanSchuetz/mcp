Funded by the Inter-American Development Bank, DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) worked with the Guyana Institute for Private Enterprise Development (IPED) to help Guyanese small and medium enterprises grow through innovative green finance products. As part of the project, SBG conducted a landscape assessment and market analysis across four regions of Guyana, including coastal, river, and rainforest areas to assess demand for renewable energy and energy efficiency (RE/EE) products among IPED clients. SBG surveyed a range of firms within IPED’s portfolio, including agriprocessors, retail shops, hostelry, and catering businesses to better understand financing constraints, average energy usage, and opportunities to incorporate RE/EE technologies and solutions. 

SBG also developed a Technology Review that assessed the supply of RE/EE technologies within the local market. In-person insights were combined with mobile survey data collection to construct a grounded analysis of challenges for MSMEs and how an innovative green financing product could address those challenges. This interview-driven analysis included an assessment of strategic partnerships that would complement the comparative advantages of IPED and ensure alignment with national programs and objectives. The project also includes the design of a digital tool for IPED’s loan officers to screen climate risk as part of their loan underwriting process and assists IPED in developing an institutional greening policy.
