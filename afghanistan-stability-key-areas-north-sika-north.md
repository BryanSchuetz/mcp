SIKA-North worked to create more resilient communities in Afghanistan that see their government officials as delivering public services and responsive to local problems. This is critical to stability, as Afghans generally assert that government effectiveness improves their personal sense of predictability, community resilience, and physical security.

The project worked with district officials to plan, design, implement, and monitor projects targeted at improving service provision and stability.
