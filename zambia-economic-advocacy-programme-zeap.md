While quality economic policy research exists within Zambia, the country's policymakers were not always aware of how to access and use this information to support economic growth. The Zambia—Economic Advocacy Programme (ZEAP) aimed to raise both the quality of research as well as improve how research results are communicated and used for advocacy. The intended outcome was more and better public debate that would lead to better economic policy and, in turn, more wealth creation and poverty alleviation.

Funded by the former U.K. Department for International Development (now called Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office), ZEAP also supported the Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ), a long-established association of business, banking, academic, and government representatives. The organisation was well placed to use its senior network to spread informed messages regarding economic policy.

The topics of importance for policy debate in Zambia need to be chosen by Zambians. ZEAP advised its think tank partners about how to choose subjects that were relevant to the country's own interests and priorities, consistent with the think tank's own agenda, and which would attract interest from policy influencers.
