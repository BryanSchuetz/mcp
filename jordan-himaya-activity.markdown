Female Jordanian survivors of violence face a multitude of challenges when going through the protection system. Survivors are often too intimidated to report their cases to the Family and Juvenile Protection Department due to fear of familial disapproval and social repercussions. Those who have gone through the system have faced questioning and little protection, leading to revictimization and uncertainty about seeking resolutions.

Service providers and stakeholders from across the Jordanian protection system require improved survivor-centered service delivery methods, better infrastructure, and innovation in violence-against-women response systems.

The *Himaya* (Arabic for protection) Activity, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is committed to advancing human rights and equitable opportunities by improving the quality and accessibility of services for violence-against-women survivors in Jordan. Himaya works closely with the Jordanian National Protection Team to advance the national protection priorities by building the capacity of service provider institutions and strengthening legislative frameworks for providing protection and responding to violence. Program interventions adopt a survivor-centered and systems-strengthening approach, integrating the needs, experiences, and views into the framework. Himaya designs and implements interventions collaboratively, ensuring that improvements in service delivery inform policy development while legislative advancements reinforce the capacities of service providers, creating a cohesive and dynamic impact on survivor support systems.
