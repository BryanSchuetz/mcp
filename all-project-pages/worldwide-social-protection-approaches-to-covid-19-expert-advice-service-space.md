Countries across the globe are using or adapting social protection systems and programs, as well as humanitarian cash assistance, to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. Getting support quickly to those in need is helping them to meet unexpected costs and compensate for the loss of income—both in the immediate and longer term as countries enter periods of COVID-driven recession.

Between April 2020 and November 2021, the Social Protection Approaches to COVID-19 Expert Advice Service (SPACE) supported decision-makers across national governments, donors, and implementing partners in more than 40 countries with independent, evidence-based, timely, and actionable advice to meet growing needs. Direct support was responsive to the unique requirements of specific actors and contexts and broadly addressed the following themes:
* Social protection and humanitarian linkages
* Program adaptation and phasing
* Shock responsive social protection
* Delivery systems including targeting and registration, transfer values, payment mechanisms, information management, communications, grievance redress mechanisms, and monitoring and evaluation
* Recovery and systems strengthening
* Digital technology
* Anti-corruption
* Economic impacts
* Localisation
* Climate and environment
* Economic inclusion
* Informal workers

SPACE was a joint initiative of the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO); GIZ (the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development); and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).

The program was managed by DAI through the FCDO framework agreement [Expert Advisory Call Down Services (EACDS) Lot B](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-expert-advisory-call-down-services-eacds) Strengthening Resilience and Response to Crises, and the helpline advice is provided by independent consultants contracted by FCDO, GIZ, DFAT, and other partners. SPACE benefitted from the support and engagement of [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/), the [Centre for Disaster Protection](https://www.disasterprotection.org/), and the [HEART Consortium](https://www.heart-resources.org/about/).
