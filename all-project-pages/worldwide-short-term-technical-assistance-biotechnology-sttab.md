Despite the potential benefits of biotechnology, few technologies throughout history have caused as much controversy. Its application has raised concerns about safety to human health and the environment, as well as issues of technology access and equity and potential impact on politics and trade. DAI provided technical assistance primarily to developing-country governments to help them make informed decisions and draft national biosafety frameworks in line with their international obligations. The DAI team provided technical assistance to build the capacity of local institutions to make decisions on issues specifically relating to cotton, food aid, trade, and biosafety, and regulation of biotechnology. The team worked with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), government counterparts, and other stakeholders to design and deliver cutting-edge conferences, study tours, and policy briefs, and to field international experts for short-term technical assignments.

### Sample Activities

* Provide rapid and targeted technical assistance to address the requests of client countries.
* Provide technical leadership and support to other USAID units and other U.S. Government agencies.

### Select Results

* Provided farmers with improved techniques to introduce new crop varieties with enhanced disease resistance, economic return capacity, and nutritional qualities.
* Increased awareness of biotechnology as it relates to the assessment of technological opportunities, how to regulate the technology, and decisions around trade and food imports in developing countries.
* Supported 10 technical conferences in cotton, food aid, trade capacity, regulation, and regional policy dialogues on biotechnology; three short-term programs on breeding of biotechnology crops or management of insect resistance in biotech cotton; 29 activities in the regulatory aspects of biotechnology; nine briefing papers related to biotechnology; two training courses in biotechnology, and one study tour.
