A quarter of a century after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Central Asian Republics have yet to realize full regional integration or sustained economic growth outside of the oil and gas industries. In addition, state control over business freedoms and rivalries among national governments have led to restrictive trade policies and stifled private sector investment, resulting in a stagnant economy and limited job opportunities. Large segments of the population remain mired in poverty, resulting in migration to find work and vulnerability to recruitment by violent extremist groups.

The U.S. Government's New Silk Road Initiative is supporting Central Asia to regain its place at the center of renewed trade between the East and West. An integral part of the initiative is the Trade Central Asia (TCA) activity, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and working in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan to improve the region's trade environment, resulting in growth for exports and increased employment.

DAI's strategy focuses on facilitating the development of competitive, inclusive market systems in the region while ensuring that activities are demand-driven and locally led to increase sustainability. TCA promotes growth in the agricultural, transport, and logistics sectors by leveraging other USAID investments in the region, including two DAI-managed activities: [Uzbekistan Agricultural Value Chains][1] and [Pakistan Regional Economic Integration Activity][2].

By 2026, we anticipate that the activity will have reduced the average time to move goods by road from Afghanistan to Kazakhstan by more than 25 percent, and that more accessible sources of information, better networking opportunities, and strengthened trade promotion service providers will generate more than $100 million in new cross-border sales.
