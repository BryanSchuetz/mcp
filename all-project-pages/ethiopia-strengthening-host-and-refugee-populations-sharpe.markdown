Field name: 
Through the innovative application of the “Markets for Resilience” approach, the Strengthening Host and Refugee Populations in Ethiopia program (SHARPE) is focused on enhancing the economies of target populations across three key regions in Ethiopia: Dollo Ado, Gambella, and Jijiga.

SHARPE drives increased self-reliance among refugees and creates economic opportunities for host communities by piloting and scaling impactful interventions. This approach is rooted in a deep understanding of the economic challenges faced by refugee and host communities. It involves close collaboration with key stakeholders—businesses, government agencies, and service providers—to make markets work better for these populations.

Additionally, SHARPE serves as a vital learning platform for both the international and Ethiopian development communities, offering insights into systemic approaches within humanitarian contexts. By the program's conclusion, SHARPE expects to benefit 125,000 people in the target populations, helping them realize increases in incomes and employment or expand access to assets through private sector-driven changes. 

The SHARPE program has entered its final year, shifting from developing new business deals to concentrating on research and evidence-based results.
