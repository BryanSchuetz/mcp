Nigeria’s water security, sanitation, and hygiene (WSSH) sector has reached an alarming state of decline, with nearly one-third of the population lacking access to improved drinking water sources and approximately two-thirds living without adequate sanitation facilities. With one of the fastest-growing urban populations in the world, Nigeria’s municipal centers in particular are likely to face increasing difficulty in meeting the water and sanitation service needs of their citizens.

Despite these challenges, reform-minded states in the country’s impoverished northern region have shown a commitment to necessary policy changes and an interest in actively collaborating with development partners. The WASH Coordination Project (WCP), funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), assisted these forward-looking states and utilities in improving WASH governance and service delivery.
