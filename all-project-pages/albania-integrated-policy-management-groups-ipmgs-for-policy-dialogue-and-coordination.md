Albania has been on the path to European Union (EU) accession since 2014, when the country was granted candidate status. The EU is supporting reforms in Albania through the Instrument for Pre-Accession, IPA II, which is based on a sector approach that aims to increase coherence between sector policy, government spending, and the achievement of results.

Integrated Policy Management Groups (IPMGs) and Sector Steering Committees (SSC) were established by the Government of Albania within priority areas and sectors to move the country closer to accession. IPMGs focus on cooperation at the steering level in good governance and public administration; competitiveness and investment; employment and skills; and integrated land management. SSCs focus on cooperation at the steering level within sectors of special importance for reforms and inter-institutional coordination, including justice reform; home affairs; public financial management; interconnectivity; and environment, and waste management.

Each IMPG/SSC has a technical secretariat. The Department for Development and Good Governance (DDGG), within the Albania Prime Minister’s Office, acts as a central secretariat to support the overall IMPG mechanism, along with the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs.
