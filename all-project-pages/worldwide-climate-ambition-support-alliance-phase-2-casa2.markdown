Often, those countries most vulnerable to changes in climate have fewer resources to mitigate against the devasting impact that these changes have on their communities. These same countries also often have less influencing power in international negotiations and related multilateral fora, where decisions are made on what global commitments and measures will be taken to address the impact.  

Funded by the U.K. Government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, the [Climate Ambition Support Alliance 2](https://casaclimate.org/) (CASA2) program seeks to enables the meaningful participation of climate-vulnerable country negotiators. This supports the ambition to reduce the prospect of rapidly escalating climate extremes and severe risks for vulnerable people and systems. 

Participation is achieved by building the capacity and capability of negotiators from climate-vulnerable countries by providing training in addition to legal, technical, strategic, diplomatic, and media support.  

The program is delivered by a consortium of technical experts who provide a mix of training as well as highly tailored, long-term support to senior negotiators from the Group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs), the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), and the Republic of the Marshall Islands which formed the High Ambition Coalition (HAC). 

CASA2 is unique in its design as all support is demand-led, at the request of negotiators and negotiating groups, to ensure continued visible leadership by climate-vulnerable countries in global processes. Our partners form small and agile teams and have developed close relationships with senior climate negotiators, allowing their support to be flexible and responsive to the priorities and demands of international 
negotiations and the shifting science and policy landscape.
