Through this project, DAI facilitated the exchange of knowledge across natural resource management (NRM) communities worldwide. CK2C supported the three fundamentals of knowledge management—information, sharing, and knowledge—through stock-taking exercises, management of a website, and training U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) mission and home office staff on the fundamentals of sound NRM.

### Sample Activities

* Identify locations in which investments in NRM have had a strong, positive impact, focusing on the "enabling conditions" (such as changes in markets, better communication of knowledge, and new infrastructure) that contributed to local success.
* Hold workshops to discuss study findings among key stakeholders at the local and national levels.
* Manage the FRAME website.
* Conduct a training needs assessment, develop competencies based on interviews and focus groups, and plan and model USAID's NRM training strategy, including developing calendars, designing and implementing curriculum, and facilitating training sessions.

### Select Results

* Hosted more than 20 partner pages, provided a platform and information technology support for nongovernmental organizations and local and international projects on the Internet through the FRAME website and webinars. Partners included the Africa Biodiversity Collaborative Group, USAID Biodiversity/Forestry Extended Team, and Asociacion de Promocion Iniciativas Ecologicas.
* Facilitated dialogue through communities of practice, which provide a collective environment for NRM practitioners at all levels to exchange ideas and documents. These communities include Transfer of Management for Protected Areas, Environmental Trends Analysis, and Natural Products.
