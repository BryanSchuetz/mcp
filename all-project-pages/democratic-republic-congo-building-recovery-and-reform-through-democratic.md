Following a seven-year civil war, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is on a path toward recovery. A constitutional referendum was successfully implemented; free, fair, and transparent elections have been held; and those elections produced a president, a national assembly, and provincial assemblies. Working at national and provincial levels, the Building Recovery and Reform through Democratic Governance in the DRC (BRDG-DRC) project provided long- and short-term consulting and technical assistance, training services, applied research, workshops, conference organization and hosting, logistical support, and commodities to advance the DRC's political transition. BRDG-DRC also awarded and administered grants to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) supporting the peace and transition process and promoting democratic governance through institutional development and civic engagement.
