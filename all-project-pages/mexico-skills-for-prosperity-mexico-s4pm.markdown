The Skills for Prosperity Mexico (SFPMx) Programme worked to prepare learners to go from the classroom to the workforce with the right skills for the job and for the marketplace.
 
Achieving inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction required changing the way government, private sector, and training providers work together. The U.K. is a leader in these kinds of Education-to-Employment (E2E) partnerships. Through SFPMx, DAI drew on best practices both from Britain’s experience and from promising Mexican models of public-private collaboration to strengthen E2E partnerships nationwide.
 
SFPMx worked to increase the market relevance and quality of technical and professional qualifications in order to increase students´ employability and their opportunities to build their own path to prosperity. To achieve this goal, the program supported Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), higher education and/or short-term training (STT) institutions to update and upgrade curricula that help young people develop new hard and soft skills, especially the most vulnerable and underserved. 

Skills for Prosperity aimed to ensure more marginalized people have opportunities to access quality education and training. The program also drove sustainable changes to increase women´s participation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM). It worked with indigenous communities to help their members access better training opportunities that increase their employability.
