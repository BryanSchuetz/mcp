Addressing climate and environmental degradation is high on the agenda for the Government of Ethiopia as it seeks to implement policies, strategies, and guidelines with the potential to achieve integrated rural development.

The Climate-Smart PSNP project is enhancing the design and planning capacities of Ethiopia’s Public Works Coordination Unit and Food Security Coordination Directorate.

Using instruments such as GIS and remote sensing for monitoring and evaluation, the project is developing a national protocol of climate-smart procedures and providing technical assistance to enable the Ministry of Agriculture to:
* Mainstream climate-smart initiatives in watershed and rangeland activities planning, and implement the Productive Safety Net Program IV.
* Enhance institutional and technical capacity in planning, implementation, and monitoring for climate-smart outcomes in PSNP4’s public works and livelihoods components.
* Generate evidence to promote dialogue on climate-sensitive development programming and climate financing.

## Sample Activities

* Map climate hazards and vulnerability together with current use of climate-smart practices and technologies.
* Design and roll out a national roadmap for mainstreaming climate-smart procedures, tools, and processes.
* Strengthen monitoring and evaluation of adaptation and resilience activities, and carbon sequestration.
* Support linkages of PSNP planning processes with adverse weather and disaster risk reduction and early warning systems.
* Perform GIS mapping and codification of watersheds and micro watersheds in 22 focus districts.

## Select Results

* Supported 22 districts in the roll-out of climate-smart approaches. 
* Trained 2,000 agriculture public officers on climate risks and how to mitigate them. 
* Revised and piloted watershed and rangeland development guidelines in 22 districts across a range of ecological areas. 
* Mainstreamed climate-smart approaches mainstreamed into PSNP manuals, guides, and training materials.  
* Carried out stocktaking process to understand land use and climate-related issues, evaluate capacities in the field, and map climate-smart practices already in use. 
* Delineated micro-watersheds in the 22 districts, including base maps that include bio-physical assessment data, current land use, land cover, and other baseline information needed in development planning.
