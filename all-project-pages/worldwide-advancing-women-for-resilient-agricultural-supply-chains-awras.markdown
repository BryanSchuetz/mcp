The Advancing Women for Resilient Agricultural Supply Chains (AWRAS) initiative brings together major corporations and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to strengthen critical supply chains by empowering women working in agriculture around the world.

The five-year project is a partnership between PepsiCo, Unilever, Danone, McCormick & Company, Nespresso, and USAID.  With combined investment of up to $50 million, AWRAS aims to increase agricultural production, enhance women’s economic empowerment, and protect supply chains from shocks and stresses, such as natural disasters.

The project also demonstrates a business case for women’s economic empowerment as a mechanism for companies to build resilient supply chains, with the ultimate aim of incentivizing more private sector actors and influencing policy to promote systemic global impact.
