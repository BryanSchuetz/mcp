DAI is a lead partner on the indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract, Comprehensive Technical Assistance for Health Supply Chain and Pharmaceutical Management (Comprehensive TA). The IDIQ is part of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s broader Next Generation Global Health Supply Chain Suite of Programs (NextGen). The competitive contracting mechanism is designed to ensure that USAID partner countries have sustainable access to safe, effective, quality-assured, and affordable health commodities. Comprehensive TA will work to develop the capacity of local systems, institutions, and individuals to sustainably manage supply chains, for both USAID-procured health commodities and those procured through other donor and national and local systems, and to strengthen local pharmaceutical management systems.  

The DAI-led consortium brings together a wide range of expertise providing technical assistance to ensure medicines, health products, and related commodities reach patients through efficient and effective local systems, with the ultimate goal of improving health outcomes. DAI’s consortium for the IDIQ consists of major subcontractor Crown Agents and nine other distinguished partners: ClickMedix; Crowley Government Services; Dalberg Consulting U.S.; EnCompass; Freight in Time; Medication Outcomes Center, School of Pharmacy and the Institute of Global Health Sciences, University of California San Francisco; Axia Institute at Michigan State University; Pamela Steele Associates; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill – Carolina Population Center; and VillageReach. We also collaborate with Crosscut and US Pharmacopeia to achieve USAID and host country objectives in strengthening supply chains.
