Since 1979, chronic instability has plagued Liberia. Peace was restored in late 2003 when warring factions signed a Comprehensive Peace Agreement, and in January 2006, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was inaugurated, marking the end of the transition to peace and the restoration of democratic self-rule. The DAI team worked with the new government to increase legitimacy, strengthen public sector management, and promote policy and institutional reforms. In addition, DAI built concrete and positive communication channels and relationships between the citizens and their state institutions.
