Over the past 10 years, El Salvador’s government, with support from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), implemented a series of important tax system reforms that helped raise an additional $2.4 billion in state revenue. Combined with reforms in public financial management (PFM), this [increase in public funds](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/el-salvador-fiscal-policy-and-expenditure-management-program-fpemp) led to improved citizen welfare, such as [higher public health spending](https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/when-tax-reform-leads-to-increased-funding-for-health-services) that has reduced child mortality and raised life expectancy. Despite these advances, the current tax effort has fallen short of its full potential, while government overspending has created a persistent fiscal deficit. In addition, municipal governments still need to improve their revenue mobilization to fund basic public services.

USAID’s Domestic Resource Mobilization Program supported local and national government partners to address these challenges through a combination of increased revenue mobilization, improved expenditure management, and enhanced public-private dialogue. The program built upon the achievements of USAID’s Tax Policy and Administration Reform project and [Fiscal Policy and Expenditure Management Program](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/el-salvador-fiscal-policy-and-expenditure-management-program-fpemp), both managed by DAI, which assisted El Salvador’s government to significantly improve revenue mobilization and public financial management. By assisting government partners to further enhance their systems for collecting and spending revenue, DAI’s Domestic Resource Mobilization team helped increase public funding to support social programs, generate employment, and reduce inequality. This support helped El Salvador to reap an additional $1.03 billion (or 2.5 percent of GDP) between 2017 and 2021. 

To ensure that the increase in revenue mobilization has the best possible impact on public value creation, El Salvador’s government, with the support of USAID, modernized its PFM system and strengthened its revenue collection. The reforms included the budget system reform, the treasury system modernization, the adoption of International Public Sector Accounting Standards, the deployment of a state-of-the-art Government Financial Information System, the development of a fully transactional e-procurement system, and the enhancement of fiscal transparency.
