Preparing food for children ages 6-24 months takes a lot of mothers' time, which is often limited by other responsibilities. In low-income neighborhoods of Kathmandu, Nepal, there is a minimal supply of, but high demand for, processed, affordable, and nutritious weaning foods that incorporate multiple food groups.

Tufts University, DAI, and Right Direction Nepal assisted a Kathmandu-based cottage industry that produces foods that complement breastfeeding. The goal: help this cottage industry to produce processed (quick and easy) weaning food for infants and toddlers at higher quality and nutrition, higher volume, and lower cost.
