regions: Sub-Saharan Africa
country: Kenya
Kenya’s debt profile changed rapidly in recent years. Large-scale public investments initiated since 2015 led to annual fiscal deficit levels above inflation and GDP growth rates. As part of a policy dialogue with Kenya and an overall European Union (EU) budget support programme of €26 million, our technical assistance supports the Public Finance Management (PFM) Reform Secretariat to successfully implement the PFM Reform Strategy (2018–2023). Better PFM will improve financial transfers to counties, enhance revenue mobilization, improve the business environment, and create better public investment management practices in Kenya. 

Ultimately, the project contributes to the promotion of macro-fiscal stability, service delivery, and poverty alleviation in Kenya.

Accountability and governance are priority sectors under the Joint Cooperation Strategy between the EU and the Government of Kenya. Our support of the implementation of the 2018-2023 PFM reform strategy falls under the EU’s focus on a well-functioning devolution process, strengthened PFM systems, increased access to justice for all, enhanced civic space, and improved women's equality. 

Our team also supports the PFM Reform Secretariat in the implementation of the Kenya PFM Communication Strategy and helps to strengthen the partnership between the EU Delegation and the Kenyan National Treasury and Planning.
