The Better Health Programme Mexico (BHPMx) was part of the U.K. Global Prosperity programme Better Health Programme that covered eight countries. The DAI-managed program addressed the growing incidence of noncommunicable diseases (NCD) in Mexico—especially in relation to obesity and diabetes—with the aim of enhancing the economic and social benefits associated with improved health.

The program fostered long-term links between Mexican institutions and the National Health Service, other U.K. institutions, and networks of researchers and service providers. U.K. and Mexican partners together built an understanding of the nature of the NCD epidemic and of the severe exclusion of some groups based on ethnicity, disability, or geographical location, as well as high levels of violence against women across the country and inequality within the health system.

### Sample Activities

* Create a mechanism for long-term, mutually beneficial collaboration between the United Kingdom and Mexico by developing frameworks for knowledge exchange and relationships between various institutions.
* Support the Mexican government in reviewing and improving policy to address obesity and diabetes and mechanisms for measuring progress and challenges. This work will complement the government’s significant efforts to reduce health inequalities.
* Support the strengthening of inclusive leadership and learning among health professionals in the Mexican health system.
* Conduct innovative research to understand some of the underlying social drivers of obesity in Mexico and support partnerships with the United Kingdom to enable high-quality learning for both the United Kingdom and the Mexican public health approach. For example, research might explore how stress and violence are linked with obesity, inactivity, depression, and poor eating habits and develop integrated approaches to tackle violence and obesity.
