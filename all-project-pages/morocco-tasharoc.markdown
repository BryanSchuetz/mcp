The Tangier-Tétouan-Al Hoceima (TTAH) in Northern Morocco has historically been a marginalised region, not benefitting from the nationwide growth Morocco has experienced over the past two decades. As a result, a burgeoning sense of disenchantment with political processes and heightened social tensions have developed throughout the region.

In the years leading up to and following King Mohammed VI’s constitutional reforms in 2011, the Kingdom of Morocco has demonstrated a commitment to decentralisation, local participation, and enhanced service delivery. Under Morocco’s Advanced Regionalisation agenda, the government aims to decentralise administrative structures, devolve policy making to locally elected governments, and incentivise active civic participation. 

The United Kingdom supported this ongoing reform process with the TASHAROC project to strengthen political representation and citizen engagement in the TTAH region. 

In partnership with the TTAH Regional Council and working closely with the regional development agency AREP, other regional stakeholders, and civil society actors, TASHAROC built the capability, accountability, and responsiveness of the council and development agency. The TASHAROC team additionally provided support to the region’s legally mandated consultative bodies and a range of civil society organisations. Much of this work was done through support to the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of regional development projects as defined by TTAH’s Plan de Développement Regional. 

TASHAROC supported inclusive development and reduced political and economic disenfranchisement in the Northern Moroccan region.
