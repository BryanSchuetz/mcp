Coinciding with the Peace Accords, Colombia's international tourist arrivals surged by 85 percent in the mid-2010s as a new generation of travelers discovered the vibrant flora, remarkable fauna, and unique ecosystems of the world’s second most biodiverse country. 

The Destination Nature Activity (DNA) is an innovative new program that embraces the emerging nature tourism industry as a central pillar for the Government of Colombia to achieve its environmental ambitions, while also meeting its social and economic commitments in the [2016 Peace Accord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Colombian_peace_agreement_referendum).
 
DNA conserves biodiversity and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by supporting rural communities to make a living from sustainable nature tourism. Nature tourism is a productive activity that enables sustainable land use and encourages biodiversity conservation, and this activity works with communities to build sustainable business models for Colombia’s nature tourism sector. 

DNA is developing an innovative and holistic model based on the concept of Regenerative Nature Tourism (RNT), which arises from the interaction and balance between healthy ecosystems, community well-being, traveler experience and businesses economic sustainability. Strengthening the community’s livelihood and the consequent improvement in their quality of life must be achieved through strategies that simultaneously contribute to biodiversity’s conservation and community well-being, which allows the creation of high added value experiences for people who wish to contribute through purposeful travel.
