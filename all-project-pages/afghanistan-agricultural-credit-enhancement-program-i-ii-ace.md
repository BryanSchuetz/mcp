For more than 25 years, Afghan farmers did not have access to agricultural credit, seriously constraining the growth of farming. DAI managed a $100 million U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) grant to the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock to provide credit to farmers, who repay their loans after their harvests. The project also provided technical assistance so that farmers and others who borrow from the Agricultural Development Fund (ADF) are well prepared to sustain and succeed.

Islamic finance and conventional loans are available to many Afghans who participate in farming, such as small commercial farmers and agriculture-related businesses. The success and future sustainability of the fund rests on three fundamental pillars: solid governance; airtight policies and procedures; and human capital. Investing in people will undoubtedly contribute to the permanence and integrity of the fund, which is why capacity development is at the core of its business strategy.
