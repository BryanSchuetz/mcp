Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is economically devastating for commercial and backyard producers alike, especially in developing countries where poultry is often a mainstay of poor households. If the virus became pandemic in the human population, it would be catastrophic in more than economic terms—and across more than just the developing world. To ensure that HPAI does not evolve into a human health crisis, the STOP AI project provided technical resources and support services in preparedness planning, surveillance, and prevention; outbreak response; and re-infection prevention and recovery. STOP AI was an emergency preparation, response, and recovery project, supported by DAI's proven capabilities in mobilizing and deploying teams worldwide, and facilitated by robust information and communication, knowledge management, and geographic information systems. Working with U.S. Government agencies, national governments, international and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and a roster of deployable veterinarians and other health experts, the project detected, responded to, and contained HPAI outbreaks.
