* Expanded 14,522 hectares of alternative crops under cultivation.
* Trained 497,009 farmers on approaches to increase agriculture productivity and 2,577 government line staff in areas related to their work.
* Provided training to 15,347 business owners to improve their business skills and increase their sales.
