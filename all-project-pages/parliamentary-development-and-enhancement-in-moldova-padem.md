As Moldova seeks European Union membership, it faces social, political, and economic pressures, including political fragmentation and frequent electoral law changes. The 2025 parliamentary elections will be crucial in shaping the country’s political future.

The Parliamentary Development and Enhancement in Moldova (PADEM) project aims to support Moldova’s Parliament in advancing reforms across key areas identified by the Parliament Secretariat. This work includes strengthening parliamentary oversight, improving legal drafting, enhancing communication with citizens, and increasing the Secretariat’s capacity to assist Members of Parliament. Through this initiative, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation is supporting Moldova to improve the Parliament’s effectiveness, accountability, and representative function.

The project has three main components: enhancing the legislative process, improving parliamentary oversight, and strengthening communication between Parliament and citizens. In collaboration with the Swiss Parliamentary Services, DAI will help build capacity within Moldova’s Parliament. This collaboration will foster knowledge transfer and institutional strengthening, improving the Parliament’s ability to review legislation, bolster its oversight functions, and enhance transparency and accountability in its interactions with the public—ultimately strengthening democratic governance in Moldova.
