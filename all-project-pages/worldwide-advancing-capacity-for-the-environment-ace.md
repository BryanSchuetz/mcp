The Advancing Capacity for the Environment (ACE) program facilitates the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s work to address weather-related changes, conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources, improve land governance, and expand access to secure, modern energy and resilient infrastructure. [ACE](https://www.climatelinks.org/resources/advancing-capacity-environment-ace-program-fact-sheet) strengthens capacities for technical leadership and effective programming through integrated support in four areas: communications, knowledge management, training, and organizational development.

The intensity and complexity of today’s environmental challenges—from ocean plastic pollution to natural resource degradation and biodiversity loss—threaten to reverse decades of progress in global development. To sustain improvements in human welfare, USAID is taking bold action to address these challenges through investments that cut across all technical sectors.

This requires a shift in Agency programming toward greater integration and collaboration, as well as enhanced policy guidance and thought leadership. ACE is designed to meet these needs through technical assistance to USAID’s Washington offices and field Missions to sustain and grow their capacities for communication, learning, and knowledge sharing.

By enhancing USAID's effectiveness, the ACE program contributes to positive, sustainable development outcomes globally with a focus on Agency programs in the environment, energy, and infrastructure sectors.

## Sample Activities

* Design and deliver the Practical, InnoVative, On the Job Training (PIVOT) change management program to advance private sector engagement in environmental action.
* Manage and update USAID’s Climatelinks.org, Land-Links.org, Urban-Links.org, and BiodiversityLinks.org websites.
* Design curriculum and multifaceted learning materials for different levels of learners.
* Co-create a Knowledge Management Strategic Plan.
* Create communications campaigns for USAID’s Save our Seas Initiative to advance policy objectives in marine protection.

## Select Results

* Facilitated communications and knowledge management products that reached more than 3,876,000 individuals to increase engagement with USAID’s Environment, Energy, and Infrastructure programming.
* Facilitated training and organizational development events with 1,794 participants to build capacity on USAID’s Environment, Energy, and Infrastructure programming.
* Introduced CommsConnect, a one-stop shop for USAID program information, fact sheets, statistics, and success stories to provide up-to-date communications and knowledge management resources to USAID’s geographically dispersed workforce across more than 90 countries.
* Managed all aspects of six “Links” websites that capture and share information to ensure that USAID’s audiences can apply lessons, experience, and evidence to improve the effectiveness of their programs. ACE has supported the development or posting of more than 1,600 resources, attracting more than 1,039,000 views and 148,000 downloads.  USAID staff (89 percent) report that awareness of USAID’s weather-related and environmental work has increased among their key audiences with ACE’s support.
* Supported 11 communities of practice among USAID staff and implementing partners to build capacity, disseminate best practices, sharpen messaging, and evaluate programming. Nearly 900 people have attended sessions.
* Supported USAID’s integrated, whole-of-agency approach to weather-related and environmental work through a robust suite of training, including Biodiversity Programing and Cross-Sectoral Integration.
