While Tanzania has a robust information and communications technologies (ICT) and digital sector (including private-sector developers, tech startups, local talent, and a burgeoning e-government ecosystem), the policy and regulatory environment has not kept pace with technological advancements. 

The Tanzania ICT Partnership: 5G/6G Frameworks and Cyber Security Capacity project supported the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Embassy Dar es Salaam, in building Tanzania’s capacity to embrace international best practices and standards that advance an open, interoperable, and secure internet; defend against authoritarian practices; and catalyze investments in goods and services related to information and ICT.
 
Tanzania ICT prepared civilian regulators for 5G and advanced technologies by providing
capacity building and technical assistance to implement regulatory frameworks, which
encourage nonproprietary OpenRAN standards to preserve a free and open telecommunications network. Additionally, Tanzania ICT promoted cybercrime frameworks and legislation that incorporate elements enshrined by the Budapest Convention on Cyber Crime to encourage criminal procedures in the digital realm aimed
to enable Tanzania as a democratic society. 

Finally, the team provided foundational-level
technical assistance and cybersecurity professional development in the buildout of
Tanzania’s Cyber Incident Response Team.
