The rapid pace of urbanization in the past decades has outpaced the development of institutional systems and infrastructure needed to manage Tanzania's transition from a low-income to a middle-income country. With ongoing changes to the climate, this trend is expected to continue, putting pressure on existing systems and increasing the risk of natural disasters.

The Green and Smart Cities SASA (*sasa* means 'now' in Swahili) project is a Team Europe Initiative that enhances the quality of life for Tanzanians by supporting green infrastructure investments, local economic growth and development, disaster risk reduction and preparedness, and improved public service delivery.

The project supports the Government of Tanzania to improve the governance of sustainable urban development through technical assistance to strengthen the institutional framework for green and smart cities.
