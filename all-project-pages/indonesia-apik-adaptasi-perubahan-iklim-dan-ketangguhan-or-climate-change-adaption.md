From the burgeoning population centers of Java to the small island communities of Maluku, the Indonesian people face increasing risk from droughts, floods, and landslides. To support the government of Indonesia in improving local resilience to these disaster threats, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) launched Adaptasi Perubahan Iklim dan Ketangguhan (APIK), or [Climate Adaption and Resilience](http://apikindonesia.or.id/en), USAID’s first project focusing exclusively on climate adaptation in Indonesia.

APIK integrated climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DDR) into national and subnational governance frameworks, built the capacity of local communities and the private sector to address weather-related hazards, and supported information for disaster risk management. By its end, APIK helped 42,197 people, including 16,246 women, be more resilient to the effects of weather disasters.

### Sample Activities

* Build local leadership and capacity through working groups that address weather and disaster risk in the context of their own development objectives.
* Leverage resources and expertise from local partners who serve as conveners, investors, information aggregators, and thought leaders.
* Tailor climate information tools and services for those on the frontlines of adaptation and disaster response, including through the application of open-source, user-centric monitoring technologies introduced by the [DAI Maker Lab.](/our-work/solutions/dai-maker-lab)
* [Target support](http://apikindonesia.or.id/en/success-story/when-women-are-in-charge-building-more-resilient-communities-two-steps-at-a-time) to those most susceptible, such as urban slum inhabitants living at the rising water's edge.

### Select Results

* Improved integration of Climate Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction into national and subnational governance frameworks. APIK helped usher more than 150 laws, policies, regulations, or standards addressing climate adaptation formally proposed, adopted, or implemented; 174 institutions improved capacity to assess or address weather-related risks.
* Strengthened capacity of local communities and the private sector to address weather-related natural hazards. More than 22,000 people [trained](https://www.climatelinks.org/blog/climate-field-schools-transforming-agricultural-risk-resilience) in climate adaptation or disaster risk reduction and water resource management, with 5,500-plus demonstrating increased capacity; more than $3.7 million investment mobilized for climate or disaster risk reduction as supported by APIK.
* Improved utilization of information for weather and disaster risk management among key stakeholders. More than 42,000 people supported to adapt to the effects of climate or be more resilient to natural disasters, including 16,246 women); 6,130 people using climate information or implementing risk-reducing actions to improve resilience.
* Supported increased local administrations’ allocations toward resilience against weather-related events. Leveraging national government resources, local administrations are investing in coastal protection activities (seawalls and mangrove reforestation), flood early warning systems; improved mapping and use of drone technology, and training and disaster simulations.
* Promoted resilience to extreme weather events as a national priority. The Indonesian Government National Mid-Term Development Plan (2020-2024) allocates $3 billion over five years for resilience work in agriculture, water, coastal, and health.
