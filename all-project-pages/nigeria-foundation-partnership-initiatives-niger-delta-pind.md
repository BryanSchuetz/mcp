DAI assisted the Chevron Corporation with the [strategic design ](https://www.devex.com/en/news/chevron/81078)of the Foundation for Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta (PIND), a Nigerian-registered [foundation,](https://www.devex.com/en/news/beyond-philanthropy-what-happens-when-a/82220) by helping outline a strategy for its economic development program, specifically orienting its activities around a market systems approach and developing monitoring and evaluating mechanisms to document their impact. Collectively, these recommendations informed the principles of intervention, program areas, sustainable outcomes, and intermediate and final impacts of the Foundation's 2011–2014 Strategic Plan. DAI also identified resources to execute the economic development component of the plan, and established criteria for prioritizing projects and selecting implementing partners.
