The Green Economy Financing Facility (GEFF Morocco II) is a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)-funded €150 million facility within the GEFF Morocco framework for Green Economy Transition investments in line with the EBRD methodology and approach to intermediated financing of sustainable energy, resource efficiency, and climate resilience technologies.

GEFF Morocco II provides financing in the form of senior unsecured loans to participating financial institutions, including banks, microfinance, and leasing companies. These loans shall be dedicated to finance private sector sub-borrowers (small firms, corporates, and households) in Morocco for investments in green technologies and services supporting green economy concepts.

GEFF Morocco II is co-financed by the European Union and the Green Climate Fund and builds on the success of the [Morocco Sustainable Energy Financing Facility (MorSEFF)](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/morocco-sustainable-energy-financing-facility-morseff) program, as well as the [Morocco Green Value Chains Facility](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/morocco-green-value-chains-morocco-gvc), both managed by DAI.
