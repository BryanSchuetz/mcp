Indonesia is a growing regional and global player, having experienced a remarkable democratic and economic transformation over the last two decades. However, the country remains at a development crossroads, with 40 percent of the population earning less than $2 a day.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)’s Mitra Kunci Initiative provided Indonesia’s poorest and most vulnerable with the skills needed to be productive members of Indonesia’s workforce. [Young people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoItcAx_xnY&feature=youtu.be), women, and people with disabilities received training, information, and resources to prepare them to meet the needs of the private sector.

By assisting Indonesia’s efforts to improve the skills needed to work in the local market, more Indonesians can break the cycle of extreme poverty, have the opportunity to reach their full potential, and contribute to global prosperity and self-reliance.

As a result of program interventions, more than 40,300 poor and vulnerable young people have new skills, including 704 young people with disabilities, and more than 15,800 poor and vulnerable young people have new or better jobs.
