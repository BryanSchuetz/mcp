Water security programming in areas affected by fragility and stressors requires complex solutions, collaboration across the humanitarian-development-peace nexus, and a strong evidence base for what works. 

The Fragile Waters mechanism provides U.S. Agency for International Development Operating Units, government ministries, service providers, regulators, basin authorities, local officials, and communities with the information and interventions needed to pivot water security approaches and programs as shocks and stressors unfold.

Fragile Waters allows local organizations, and other stakeholders to sequence, layer, and integrate water security activities; make effective programming decisions; develop robust and resilient local water, sanitation, and hygiene systems capable of adapting to stress; and address water-related drivers of fragility and vulnerability resulting from conflicts, weather events, and climate shocks.
