Changes in climate can particularly affect urban life, especially in terms of basic services, infrastructure, housing, livelihoods, and health. As hubs of innovation and creativity, cities have an important role to play in preparing for and adapting to the risks posed by adverse weather.

The Global Covenant of Mayors (GCoM) for Climate and Energy aims to strengthen the role of cities on the wider international scene and provide operational tools for effective action. Regional and national covenants serve as local chapters of the broader GCoM alliance. Our team supports the GCoM in East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, assisting signatory cities and partners in their commitments while encouraging new cities and urban stakeholders to join the GCoM alliance in pursuit of a shared vision for a resilient and low-emission future.
