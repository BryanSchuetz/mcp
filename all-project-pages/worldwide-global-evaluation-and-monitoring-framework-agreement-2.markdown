The Global Evaluation and Monitoring Framework Agreement 2 (GEMFA2) is a framework contract through which the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and other U.K. Government departments may access monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) services.
 
GEMFA2 is part of an evolving DAI MEL portfolio that reflects our commitment to learning, collaboration, and evidence generation to support better outcomes across the U.K. Government’s global work.

Using GEMFA2, British government clients are able to commission multidisciplinary teams of high-quality professionals to design, manage, and deliver MEL services across thematic areas including climate and nature; global health; education; finance; governance; stability, conflict and resilience; technology; and gender and equalities.
 
The DAI-led consortium for GEMFA2 specifically holds Lot 1: Global High-Value Contracts, meaning contracts above £750,000 in value. DAI also holds a position on the Portfolio, Emergency, and ICAI MEL extensions to the framework—ICAI is the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, which is responsible for scrutiny of U.K. aid.
 
Most GEFMA2 service requests will involve programmes funded by U.K. Official Development Assistance (ODA). However, the FCDO also requires Lead Framework Suppliers such as DAI to be able to deliver non-ODA-funded programmes that involve development-adjacent disciplines such as diplomacy, defence, trade, investment, technology, and science, in line with the government’s multifaceted International Development Strategy.
 
DAI leads a GEFMA2 consortium whose members include the University of Portsmouth, Consilient Limited, and 3B Impact. Our response framework call-down opportunities are managed by DAI’s Consultancy and Research Team. DAI has considerable experience managing consortia for similar frameworks, including FCDO’s [Expert Advisory Call Down Service Lot B](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-expert-advisory-call-down-services-eacds), the previous iteration of [GEMFA](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-global-evaluation-and-monitoring-framework-agreement-gemfa-lot-4), and its predecessor framework, [GEFA](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-global-evaluation-framework-agreement-1-and-2).
