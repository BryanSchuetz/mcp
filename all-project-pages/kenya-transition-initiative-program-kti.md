Adopted in the wake of flawed national elections and resulting interethnic violence in 2007, Kenya's February 2008 peace accord and power-sharing agreement afford Kenyans the political framework around which they can begin to rebuild their country. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)'s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) worked to help Kenya restore its position as an anchor of stability in the Greater Horn of Africa region. Through assistance in reducing tensions and by enabling economic, political, and social recovery, the Kenya Transition Initiative Program (KTI) helped to renew the nation's confidence and capacity in addressing instability, political marginalization, and violence.

### Sample Activities

* Increase capacity of Kenyan state and nonstate actors to promote and enable broad-based recovery from the 2007–2008 election-related violence.
* Enable public institutions to undertake fundamental reforms and manage instability and uncertainty.
* Mobilize the public and key change agents, especially youth, to mobilize and demand accountability, reform, and an end to impunity for corruption, and to resist political manipulation.
* Provide livelihoods, opportunities, and business skills for youth.

### Select Results

* In Burnt Forest, constructed new "peace" market jointly built, owned, operated by the Kikuyu and Kalenjin communities with the Rural Women's Peace Link.
* Assisted the Government of Kenya in the formation of district peace committees. By assisting in organizing these networks of community members from across the different ethnic groups, KTI was able to strengthen community response mechanisms and help communities deal with potential conflict triggers such as elections, natural disasters, or crime.
* Through support to the Civic Societies Organization Network, set up a savings cooperative society, which trained young moto drivers on the importance of savings and pooling resources; and empowered the Kisumu Joint Bunge, an informal community parliament, to establish youth forums for information exchange and dialogue.
* Awarded grants to help the Government of Kenya provide live television and radio broadcasts of Parliament to increase transparency.
