Lebanese agricultural products have the potential to compete well in regional and international markets; however many products require improvements in terms of quality and specifications to meet customer demand, leveraging the country's significant assets and abundant talented human resources. In addition, the country is affected by the regional crisis, particularly in rural areas. 

The Lebanon Industry Value Chain Development (LIVCD) was a six-year project under the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future initiative. By facilitating 211 public-private partnerships and generating $140 million in sales by Lebanese farmers and companies, LIVCD strengthened the agriculture and agro-processing sectors and supported Lebanese products to become more competitive in both domestic and international markets. The project started with comprehensive and consultative evaluations of potential value chains for project interventions, to identify constraints and pinpoint windows for development opportunities.

Instrumental to sustainability and partner buy-in, LIVCD held a cost-sharing philosophy where prospective partners contributed at least a 25 to 50 percent cost share, often even more. The project used facilitation techniques and targeted in-kind and technical support to craft private sector-led, Lebanese-owned interventions. LIVCD provided $14 million in technical support and grants across nine value chains that stimulated innovation; generated $41 million in private sector and farmers’ leveraged investments; and trained 1,255 micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) on ways to access finance and loans, 103 of which successfully obtained bank loans or private equity. LIVCD both raised awareness of financing options and helped individual companies with their loan applications. This support resulted in $19 million in loans disbursed to LIVCD beneficiaries during the life of the project.
