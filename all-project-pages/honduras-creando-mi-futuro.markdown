Instability, violence, and economic fragility are generating dislocation and disillusionment among Honduran youth, leading to record levels of outmigration. Honduras’s largest potential economic assets—its youth—are fleeing the country at an alarming rate. Comprising 53 percent of the population, youth represent an enormous economic opportunity for Honduras. The Honduras *Creando Mi Futuro Aquí* (Creating My Future Here) Activity works to increase the employment of young people at risk of irregular migration to the United States by increasing their educational and income-generating opportunities.
 
Working in partnership with public and private sector stakeholders, *Creando* aims to reach at least 500,000 youth at risk of irregular migration with a variety of services to assist them in becoming productively engaged in the Honduran economy and society. The Activity assists youth to secure viable employment; return to and/or complete their full formal education, alternative education, or technical and vocational training; and create innovative youth enterprises—including social enterprises—that will give youth a sense of accomplishment, stability, and financial security.
 
By the end of *Creando*—with 500,000 young people engaged and 100,000 newly employed—the project will have laid the foundation for an economically empowered generation of Hondurans to forge close ties to their communities and have confidence in a future where they can achieve their goals.

## Select Results

* Supported the Ministry of Education (MOE) in improving school retention efforts and providing students with workforce development training. During the 2023 school year, *Creando* supported the MOE’s back-to-school efforts by joining its *Inicia con la Educación* (Start with Education) campaign. The campaign reached 263,058 people through traditional and social media.
* Leveraged private sector resources to refurbish damaged schools and promote back-to-school efforts. The team channeled $519,708 in in-kind donations from businesses to support more than 20,400 economically disadvantaged students returning to school. 
* Trained 1,687 at-risk young people with micro-entrepreneurship skills to date. The young people have learned how to develop a business plan, conduct simple market analyses, balance finances, and how to increase revenue from a company’s perspective. 
* Coordinated various workforce development training and employment activities with private and public sector partners. The project delivered soft and employability skills training to 73,444 young people at the request of employers. In its second year, *Creando* placed 10,893 full-time jobs through these collaborative efforts with the private sector. 
* Launched a program to strengthen community-police relationships by training 1,000 final-year police candidates at the National Police Institute in soft skills and human rights, among other important skills.
