Georgia is a country at the crossroads of Asia and Europe on a vital trading and transit route for goods and services. In recent years, Georgia signed free trade agreements that greatly expand Georgia's market access. The USAID Economic Security Program assisted Georgian firms to take advantage of the country’s market access and location to exploit regional economic opportunities and compete with international competitors for Georgia's domestic market.

The [USAID Economic Security Program](https://www.facebook.com/EconSecProgram) focused on enterprises outside of agriculture with strong potential to create jobs, increase incomes, and increase revenues, as well as support diversification to more productive economic activities, including tourism, light manufacturing, creative industries, shared intellectual services, and solid waste management sectors.

DAI applied a facilitative value chain development approach that placed market actors and other value chain stakeholders (public and private) at the center of the change process, inviting them to define problems and co-create solutions. Using timebound “smart incentives,” the program then co-invested with market actors in their own pro-growth solutions.
