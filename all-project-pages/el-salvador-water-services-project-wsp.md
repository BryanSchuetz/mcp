Dwindling water availability, increasing pollution, and extreme weather events have led to growing water insecurity in El Salvador. A lack of trust has developed between the National Administration of Aqueducts and Sewers (ANDA) and its customers due to a history of poor customer orientation, a lack of communication channels between customers and the service providers, inaccurate billing, and lack of reporting of and timely response to issues.

Part of the U.S. Agency for International Development's broader efforts to improve water management and governance in the region, the Water Services Project (WSP) aims to improve the quality of—and access to—water services in urban areas serviced by ANDA.

Building off [support to ANDA](https://dai-global-developments.com/articles/how-increasing-tax-revenue-shapes-the-lives-of-salvadorans/) that started in a [previous project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/el-salvador-domestic-resource-mobilization-program), WSP team works to implement reforms to improve the regularity of water service, promote transparency in how tariffs are applied, build public confidence in ANDA, and stem non-revenue water loss due to failing infrastructure and poor billing practices.
