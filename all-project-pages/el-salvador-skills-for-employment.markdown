Amid a deadly global pandemic that has accentuated conditions of vulnerability and economic disparities, many Salvadorans have made the painful decision to leave their homes in search of better economic opportunities.

These challenges require a systemic approach that equips Salvadoran organizations to lead and sustain systemic change. On the *Proyecto Habilidades para el Empleo* project, DAI serves as a mentor to El Salvadoran partners, enabling them to lead improvements in the country’s workforce development system by strengthening connections and capacity at all levels. Our assistance enhances their ability to improve human capital and strengthen job training and placement outcomes for vulnerable populations and for likely migrants.

Between 2023 and 2028, the project will partner with local organizations to provide market-relevant skills training to 12,000 individuals, helping at least 4,000 get their start in the workforce or gain better employment.
