The [Health Pooled Fund](https://medium.com/@HPFSouthSudan), supported by multiple donors, focused on successfully strengthening health systems and delivering essential health services in South Sudan. DAI Global Health was a core partner in a consortium led by Crown Agents. Within the fund were 23 other implementing partners that supported primary health care services in health facilities, including hospitals, across 55 counties.

As part of the consortium, DAI Global Health lead the Health Systems Strengthening, Inclusion, and Community Engagement project activities.
