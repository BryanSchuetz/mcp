The young generation of today is the largest in history—posing both a challenge and an opportunity for international cooperation and development. Young people face important challenges linked to job creation and labor markets, employability, displacement and migration, conflict, violent extremism, and the effects of changes in climate. With its bilateral, regional, continental, and global partners, reaching the young generation is one of the European Union’s key priorities both within and outside its borders.

Our project assisted the European Commission’s Directorate General for International Partnerships (DG INTPA) in identifying best practices for youth actions around the world, with a view to formulate future actions to fill existing gaps and to ensure the largest impact and coherence with other activities. The project also supported the launch of the European Union (EU)’s [Youth Sounding Board](https://ec.europa.eu/international-partnerships/news/youth-sounding-board-kickstarts-its-work_en), aimed at giving young people a voice on topics related to EU’s development cooperation.
