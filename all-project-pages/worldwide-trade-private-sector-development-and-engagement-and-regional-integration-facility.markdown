Trade and private sector engagement are recognized as key drivers for poverty reduction given their ability to spur growth and investment, create good-quality jobs, and generate tax revenues to fund public services. However, improved market access alone is not always sufficient for sustained economic development. Access often needs to be complemented by policy measures that support lasting and equitable prosperity.

The Trade and Private Sector Development (TPSD) Facility I (2017-2021) was established to support the implementation of the EU’s 2014 Private Sector Communication and to shape and implement new policy orientations, in particular those geared toward the EU’s External Investment Plan. Through TPSD I, DAI provided technical expertise to EU staff working on private sector and trade in Brussels and worldwide, created and shared knowledge inside the institution, and supported the visibility of the Directorate-General for International Partnerships (DG INTPA).

TPSD II (2021-2025) consolidated and expanded on the gains made in building the capacity and knowledge of EU institutions to deliver results. Its efforts aligned with the priorities of the EU Global Gateway, also launched in December 2021. Our experts particularly focused on the investment climate for Global Gateway, private sector adaptation to Green Deal regulations, and financing the Global Gateway. Additionally, TPSDE II brought technical, strategic, and organizational support to the management of the Team Europe Initiative Investing in Young Businesses in Africa (TEI IYBA). 

TPSD III (2025-2030) will build on its eight years of experience and a growing community of practice among EU institutions to ensure that Global Gateway investments and EU interventions create equitable and sustainable growth and jobs. The team of experts will continue to provide on-demand assessments and recommendations for INTPA interventions on trade, private sector development, and investment climate reform, including support to IYBA.
