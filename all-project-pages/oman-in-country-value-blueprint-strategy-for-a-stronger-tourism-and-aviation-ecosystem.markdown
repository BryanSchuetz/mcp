Oman’s Vision 2040 outlines an ambitious roadmap for economic diversification, with tourism and aviation playing a pivotal role in reducing reliance on oil revenues and creating sustainable growth. To align with these national goals, OMRAN Group, Oman Air, and Oman Airports—three key players in Oman’s tourism and aviation sectors—partnered with SBG to develop a comprehensive In-Country Value (ICV) blueprint strategy. In Oman, in-country value is defined as the total spend retained in-country that benefits business development, contributes to human capability, and stimulates productivity in Oman’s economy.

## A Collaborative Effort for Sustainable Growth
With the Oman Investment Authority (OIA) spearheading efforts to localize manufacturing, invest in Omani talent, and strengthen local supply chains, this project aimed to enhance ICV contributions within tourism and aviation. SBG was selected as the strategic partner due to its deep expertise in economic development, sector-specific supply chain analysis, and innovative data-driven methodologies. By leveraging our cutting-edge analytics capabilities, we provided the clients with a clear and actionable roadmap for maximizing ICV contributions.

## Data-Driven Insights & Stakeholder Engagement
The project’s foundation was a rigorous data analysis process. SBG customized its proprietary ICV estimation model to align with the client’s specific objectives, applying it to assess procurement data, workforce trends, and sector-specific opportunities. By integrating complex data analytics with industry expertise, we identified high-impact areas for ICV development over a five-year period while forecasting long-term supply chain growth over the next decade. This evidence-based approach provided the clients with a clear strategy for prioritizing key investments and workforce initiatives.

SBG also conducted over 50 stakeholder interviews to consolidate the quantitative data with qualitative insights that provided a deeper understanding of structural factors influencing ICV development. This balance of technical rigor and on-the-ground engagement allowed us to shape a strategic framework that aligns with market dynamics and national objectives.

## Strategic Framework & Key Recommendations
SBG’s expertise in cross-sector collaboration and economic transformation informed the development of a strategy that leverages the natural synergy between tourism and aviation. Our approach provided a clear and actionable set of initiatives, including:
* Strengthening linkages between hospitality and aviation to support tourism growth in rural areas that have the potential to be attractive tourist destinations.
* Investing in Omani workforce training programs to boost local employment opportunities.
* Enhancing procurement practices to maximize local supplier participation.
* Implementing structural reforms to create a more ICV-friendly business environment.

By combining advanced analytics with strategic industry expertise, SBG delivered a tailored roadmap that empowers our clients to drive long-term economic impact, create jobs, and build a sustainable tourism and aviation ecosystem in Oman.
