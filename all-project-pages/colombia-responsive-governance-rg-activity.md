The Responsive Governance (RG) Activity enhances good governance, public financial management, and effective public service delivery in conflict-affected municipalities in Colombia. To increase citizen trust in the Colombian Government, RG strengthens public officials and institutions’ capacity to effectively plan, finance, and deliver vital public services, such as health and education. RG also empowers citizens to participate in their communities and promotes government accountability and responsiveness to citizen interests. RG is implemented in 34 municipalities.

Working at the intersection of public financial management (PFM), local governance, and conflict programming, RG seizes a moment of opportunity to promote effective governance and support Colombian institutions and systems as they enter the next phase of peace implementation. With Colombian partner organizations Transparencia por Colombia, Pastoral Social, and Corpovisionarios, RG builds on the decentralization efforts supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Government of Colombia to emphasize visible and sustainable improvements in service delivery and implementation of the Peace Accords.

### Sample Activities

* Strengthen national government policies, systems, mechanisms, and institutions to improve public service delivery in targeted municipalities.
* Enhance municipal public financial management to comply with national standards, increase revenues, and promote the implementation of the Peace Agreement.
* Collaborate with civil society, the media, academia, and the private sector to strengthen and increase their participation in local governance processes and the implementation of the Peace Agreement.
* Strengthen the capacity of oversight institutions to monitor public resources in the health, education, and infrastructure sectors. RG collaborates with the Comptroller General’s Office, the Inspector General’s Office, local controllers, and municipal representatives, known as Personerías.
* Employ a rapid response mechanism to adapt to evolving contexts by collaborating with strategic local partners to identify emerging dynamics, opportunities, and challenges specific to the local context.
