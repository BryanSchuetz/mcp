Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) is Pakistan's smallest province, but it ranks third in population and economic activity. KP's relative vitality and diversity are offset by unstable public services and its vulnerability to militancy. The province, though, has seen incremental gains in stability in the past few years.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governance Program (KPG) assisted the provincial government and civil society organizations to improve local government service and better serve citizens. It managed a mechanism for supporting activities that reinforced stability, counter extremism, and promoted democratic inclusiveness, including for women and other marginalized groups.

## Sample Activities

* Leverage current KP government initiatives and systems with government taking the lead role.
* Deliver integrated assistance packages in areas such as training government units to improve services and accountability.
* Improve government's publicizing of its successes, services, and opportunities available for its citizens—especially women and vulnerable groups—as well as its receptivity to community input.
* Incorporate a rigorous system for adaptive learning and management in areas such as grant making, procurement, operations, and monitoring and evaluation.

### Select Results

* Supported the launch of the ZAMA AWAZ helpline for violence and harassment against women. Women across the KP can now call the helpline and register their problems with the telephone operators. The establishment of the helpline is part of KPG's aim to strengthen the KP Women Parliamentary Caucus and Provincial Commission on the Status of Women to play a more strategic advocacy role in the province.
* Supported a digital youth summit in May 2017, hosted by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Information Technology Board in Peshawar. The Summit provided an opportunity to a large number of young job seekers and potential entrepreneurs from the province to come under one roof and interact with national and international businesses and IT experts.
* Supported an awareness campaign about local health services, hosted by the Asia Humanitarian Organization.
