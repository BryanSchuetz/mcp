client: Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office
solutions:
- Governance
- Institutional and Policy Reform
regions: Sub-Saharan Africa
country: Kenya
Despite significant economic growth in recent years, Kenya continues to rank low in key human development indicators due to substandard public services, recurring election-related instability, and non-inclusive markets and institutions. An overall ineffective social contract combined with weak governmental accountability have kept average Kenyans from experiencing the tangible benefits of economic progress in their daily lives.

The Kenya Deepening Democracy Programme (DDP), funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, promoted more inclusive governance in Kenya by improving electoral processes and enhancing government accountability. DDP built upon governance reforms previously accomplished through DFID’s [Drivers of Accountability Programme](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/kenya-drivers-accountability-programme-dap) to increase the credibility of elections and transparency of public service delivery and contribute to the achievement of Kenya’s Vision 2030 for “a more globally competitive and prosperous nation with a high quality of life.”
