DAI Global Health was part of a consortium led by PATH that worked to increase coverage of effective multi-sectoral programs to reduce undernutrition in countries that have signed on to the [Scaling Up Nutrition](http://scalingupnutrition.org), or SUN, movement.

[MQSUN+](https://mqsunplus.path.org/) provided multi-disciplinary, highly qualified expert teams, including nutritionists, economists, statisticians, social economists, and other specialists in key areas such as public health; agriculture and food security; law; social protection, water, sanitation, and hygiene; education; governance; and women.

MQSUN+ built upon the successes of the previous MQSUN Framework Agreement.

### Sample Activities

* Transform, through the MQSUN+ framework, the multi-sectoral response to malnutrition in conflict-affected Karamoja, Uganda. The aim is to shift from a humanitarian response to an approach focused on strengthening the institutions and systems necessary for the Government of Uganda to effectively manage and be accountable for delivering health and relief services, including the multi-sectoral response necessary to address malnutrition.
* Provide policy and budget cycle management assistance to governments in the SUN Movement and to the SUN Movement Secretariat to catalyze country efforts to scale up nutrition impact.
* Assist the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) to maximize the quality and effectiveness of its nutrition-related programs.
* Support evidence generation and lesson learning around the global targets to reduce malnutrition.
* Increase innovation in nutrition programs.

### Select Results

In the first phase of the MQSUN program, which ran from 2012 to 2016, we:

* Provided technical support to harmonize nutrition-related indicators, targets, and outcomes across multiple donors and sectors (notably agriculture, education, health, and social protection) to support plans for scaling up nutrition-related interventions in Kenya.
* Assessed, evaluated, and peer-reviewed national sectoral documents such as strategic plans and monitoring and evaluation frameworks for nutrition, and established systems for multi-sectoral strategic planning and analysis, costing, financial tracking and budgeting for El Salvador, Ghana, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, Swaziland, Tajikistan, and Yemen.
* Reviewed national nutrition policies and plans to support the leveraging of a global resource commitment for nutrition at the G8 Nutrition for Growth event in 2013.
