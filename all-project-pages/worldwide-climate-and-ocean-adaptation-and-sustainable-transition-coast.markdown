The U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) Climate and Ocean Adaptation and Sustainable Transition (COAST) program works to improve vulnerable coastal communities’ resilience to changes in climate and prosperity from a more sustainable use of their marine environment. 

DAI is responsible for delivering COAST Component A, which is implemented in two phases. Phase One occurs in Indonesia, Mozambique, the Philippines, and Vietnam over 24 months. Phase 2 countries, including Nigeria and Bangladesh, will be added in year three and will be agreed upon in conjunction with the FCDO. 
 
Component A centers on regenerating natural ecosystems, fostering community resilience, and nurturing relationships through contextualized policies that support universal well-being. The program emphasizes collaboration and local integration, with activities tailored to each country's needs and political agendas. Component A is split into three subcomponents: 

* Sub-component 1 uses technical assistance, political economy analysis, and capacity building to support planning and policy reform in each country, including integrating ocean and climate objectives into non-ocean sector policies and plans. 
* Sub-component 2 is the provision and management of grants to support action at local levels in support of the overarching themes. 
* Sub-component 3 is demand-led support to any countries eligible for U.K. overseas development aid to improve responsive coastal governance. 
  
Our partners are the Wildlife Conservation Society, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and Blue Green Advisors, with DEVLEARN as the monitoring, evaluation, and learning partner.
