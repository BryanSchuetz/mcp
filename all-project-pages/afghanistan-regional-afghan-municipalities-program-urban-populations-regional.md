The Regional Afghan Municipalities Program for Urban Populations, Regional Command East (RAMP UP East) supported 14 provincial capitals. Its primary customers were municipal officials such as mayors, revenue officers, and engineers as well as the citizens who benefit from municipal services.

RAMP UP East helped municipalities implement projects through which local officials improved their capacity to deliver services and build satisfaction, trust, and support among citizens.
