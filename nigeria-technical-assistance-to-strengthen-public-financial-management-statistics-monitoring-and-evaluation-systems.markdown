In Yobe state, Nigeria, high levels of poverty and insufficient access to social services, combined with the effect of Boko Haram crisis on social infrastructure and the livelihoods of citizens, call for a broader fiscal space and improved delivery of basic services.

This project assisted Yobe State in building upon the significant progress made so far in fiscal transparency and discipline, by finding ways to broaden the fiscal space sustainably while ensuring improved delivery of public goods and services.

The project fell under the European Union’s support for early recovery from conflict and resilience building in Yobe State. DAI’s technical assistance team worked with local government officials, civil servants, and civil society to support public finance management reform and improve statistics, monitoring, accountability, and reporting, including legislative scrutiny, third-party monitoring, and budget tracking by citizens. The team worked to strengthen the state’s aggregate fiscal discipline and ensure more efficient allocation and use of resources.
