The Expanding Social Protection Programme Phase II (ESP II) delivered unconditional monthly cash transfers to people 80 and older across Uganda. With funding from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), IrishAid, and Government of Uganda, as of 2019, ESP II was delivering senior citizen grants in 61 districts of Uganda. In November 2018, Parliament and Cabinet committed to a national rollout of the grants in all 135 districts of Uganda by 2021.

Under ESP II, DAI managed a Fund Management Team, hosted by the ESP Programme Management Unit. DAI managed donor partner funds and provides technical and capacity development assistance to the Government of Uganda to enable effective implementation of the program nationally. DAI was also tasked with catalyzing the formation of a coherent and comprehensive social protection system in Uganda beyond the grant program.

Nine years after the first pilot payment, ESP officially reached all eligible beneficiaries in Uganda’s 135 districts. By the end of DAI's management of the project, 379,801 people—218,205 women and 161,596 men—were receiving their entitlement of UGX 25,000 every month.
