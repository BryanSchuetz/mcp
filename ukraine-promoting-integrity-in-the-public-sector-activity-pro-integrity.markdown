Nine years on from the Revolution of Dignity and one and half years since Russia’s full-scale invasion, corruption continues to be an impediment for Ukraine to realize its full potential. Despite many successes since the Revolution, including establishing a modern specialized anti-corruption architecture, corruption problems continue to pervade the government and economy, undermining public confidence in governance institutions, hindering democratic consolidation, and posing challenges for Ukraine’s ability to recover and rebuild. 

The Promoting Integrity in the Public Sector Activity (Pro-Integrity) program addresses the root causes of corruption and tackles corruption risks at the national institutional level, at the local government level, and in issues related to Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction.

Pro-Integrity works to: strengthen national-level anti-corruption institutional capacity to advance corruption prevention, detection, and deterrence; strengthen anti-corruption compliance and control in local governance; and advance transparency and accountability in resilience, recovery, and reconstruction efforts.
