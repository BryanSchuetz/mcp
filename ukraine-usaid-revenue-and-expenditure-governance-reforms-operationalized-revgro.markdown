Ukraine is facing a protracted war of attrition, which has turned into a war for resources. Nearly all of the Government’s domestic resources are absorbed by the war. At this juncture, it is critical to increase revenue mobilization and support more efficient and transparent management of expenditures so that the Government can continue to deliver critical services to its citizens while maintaining the war effort and rebuilding the country.
