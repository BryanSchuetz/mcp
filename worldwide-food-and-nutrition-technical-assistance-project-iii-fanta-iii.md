In addition to driving employment and income, agriculture contributes to good health. However, too often products such as livestock, vegetables, and cereals are produced without regard to how they can help people living nearby improve their diets and nutritional status. In many countries, babies, toddlers, and teens grow up undernourished and, as a result, shorter in stature and slower in school. Due to malnutrition, a generation of children is not developing close to its potential. Neither are the communities in which they live.

Starting in  2003, FANTA worked to improve and strengthen nutrition and food security policies, strategies, programs, and systems in Asian, African, and Central American countries. FANTA responded to USAID mission requests to support project implementers, provided thought leadership to develop diagnostic tools, and promoted agricultural best practices using improved technology to assist projects in improving nutrition outcomes. DAI's sub-award focused on strengthening the linkages between agriculture and nutrition.
