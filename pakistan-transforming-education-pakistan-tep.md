The Transforming Education in Pakistan (TEP) programme managed a political advocacy and media campaign in Pakistan to ensure that parents and communities demand good-quality education and that the government takes tangible steps to provide [free quality education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nciO3A-MhI) to all children between the ages of 5 and 16. The campaign, *Alif Ailaan*, worked through six core strands—political and government, media, research, digital/social media, civil society and alliances. 

*Alif Ailaan* embedded specific education issues into the discourse, set a precedent of data-informed journalism and reporting on education, pioneered a series of ground-breaking publications, and successfully lobbied for the government to research, calculate, and publish a nationally accepted number for out-of-school children between the ages of 5 and 16. The campaign also focused on lobbying for and getting key stakeholders to demand quality learning available in the classrooms of government schools, which are the only schools available to the poorest children.
