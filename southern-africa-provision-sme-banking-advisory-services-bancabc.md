BancABC is a pan-African financial services group that operates in five countries: Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The bank is developing a new business line focused on retail banking and lending to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).

ABC Bank obtained a $13 million loan from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to strengthen the capital base of its Zambia, Mozambique, and Botswana operations. This gave the bank the capacity to expand into the micro and small business market segments. DAI helped BancABC build efficient and profitable operations that increased financial intermediation. This helped diversify BancABC's portfolio with a new viable business line as well as support MSMEs to realize their full potential and make a larger contribution to each country's gross domestic product.
