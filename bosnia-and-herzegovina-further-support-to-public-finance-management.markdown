Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has a unique and complex system of public finance. Its general government sector includes institutions of BiH, entity governments (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska), Brčko District, cantonal and city/municipal authorities, and extrabudgetary funds.

The Further Support to Public Finance Management project enabled authorities in BiH to improve public finance management by increasing expenditure effectiveness and the budget planning process.

In terms of budget planning, the project strengthened organizational frameworks, developed a detailed structure of budget users, and created performance indicators to ensure that mid-term budget planning is accepted by all state governments and entities so the process can achieve the results of government policies as stated in the Framework Budget Document. Additionally, the project developed the skills of the relevant financial institutions' staffers by sharing expertise from member states and current European Union candidate states, to improve the process for budget planning at all levels of government.
