DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) was contracted by an international energy company to design its internal strategy for corporate social investment (CSI) in Guyana. Throughout the process, SBG took into consideration the client’s core business objectives, philosophy, and outlook. SBG utilized our global experience in social investment, deep understanding of Guyana’s current socioeconomic development priorities and opportunities, and best practices and approaches to CSI globally to curate a CSI design strategy. SBG worked collaboratively with the client to ensure their objectives were met as well as undertook an extensive review of political, economic, and social impact initiatives in Guyana. Based on input from the client from the strategy workshop and analysis of potential CSI programs, SBG presented a final strategy to the client to provide guidance on how best to approach social investment to provide a meaningful contribution towards sustainable development in Guyana and strengthen key stakeholder relationships.
