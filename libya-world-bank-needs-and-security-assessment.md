The goal of this assessment was to update World Bank understanding in Libya, increase the specificity of its knowledge about critical institutions and themes, and broaden the base of Libyan sources for future use by the bank. There are significant knowledge gaps in the international understanding of the challenges and risks in Libya, and DAI worked to fill these gaps from a perspective sensitive to the Libyan context.

### Sample Activities

* Identify groups or individuals that stand to materially and substantially affect the country's transition to democracy.
* Identify and describe the motivations, aspirations, grievances, and organizational capabilities that might contribute to, or mitigate, the potential for conflict.
* Examine formal and informal institutions, central and in the regions, and identify their strengths and weaknesses vis-à-vis the transition process, with priority given to key managerial institutions, including the office of the Prime Minister, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Reconstruction, and Ministry of Justice, as well as regional, municipal, and key ad hoc institutions.
