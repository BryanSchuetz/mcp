The Advisory Service in Social Transfers phase III programme (ASiST III) provided on-demand support to partner countries and European Union (EU) delegations in [addressing food security](https://www.dai.com/news/dais-asist-progamme-produces-documentary-on-food-security-in-madagascar) through national social transfer schemes. ASiST III completed 182 assignments since 2015, examining the roles of public financial management, sustainable agriculture, rural development, and other factors in social transfer programmes and resilience to food crises.

These services assisted countries and EU delegations to maximise the impact of food security and social transfer programmes and to develop a graduation plan to move from short-term, emergency social transfers to systemic national safety net programmes. For country-specific requests, ASiST provided guidance throughout the project cycle management, including programme design and monitoring and evaluation. ASiST also provided technical assistance on strategic issues, such as building partnerships with other donors and projects and offering feedback on policy documents.
