Since Russia's full-scale invasion, the European Union (EU) and its partners have mobilized nearly €124 billion to support Ukraine's urgent needs and bolster its defense efforts. To sustain long-term recovery and guide Ukraine toward EU accession, the EU established the [Ukraine Facility](https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/european-neighbourhood-policy/countries-region/ukraine/ukraine-facility_en)—a €50 billion framework for 2024-2027, comprising €17 billion in grants and €33 billion in loans.

DAI provides technical assistance to the EU to ensure the effective, efficient, and transparent management of funds for Ukraine's reconstruction.

The Ukraine Facility Audit Board and its Secretariat, established under this contract, ensures financial oversight of EU funds dedicated to Ukraine’s recovery. The Secretariat supports the Audit Board in providing assessments, conducting audits, and collaborating with EU bodies to guarantee the integrity of financial assistance. Through the day-to-day management of the Secretariat, the project enhances the financial governance of the Ukraine Facility, ensuring that every euro contributes to rebuilding a resilient Ukraine.
