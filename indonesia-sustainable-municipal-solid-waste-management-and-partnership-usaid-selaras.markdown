The Government of Indonesia is establishing a National Solid Waste Management Platform to drive innovation in solid waste management and assist cities in advancing up the waste management ladder. The platform is only the latest action by the Government of Indonesia to address ocean plastic pollution. In 2020, the government launched the Indonesia National Plastics Action Partnership, a multi-stakeholder alliance that helps advance the achievement of national waste and development goals.

The Sustainable Municipal Solid Waste Management and Partnership (SELARAS) project supports all these initiatives—working to enhance waste service delivery and curtail ocean plastic pollution.

Through SELARAS, DAI supports the Government of Indonesia to improve governance, policy instruments, and markets that drive waste management innovations. Our interventions at national and subnational levels, emphasize integrated, city-centric, data-informed solutions that improve sector governance, expand sustainable service delivery, accelerate market innovations, and empower communities to ensure that waste management evolves as an inclusive and accountable service.

SELARAS builds on DAI’s decades of work in Indonesia across related sectors such as environmental services, water, sanitation, climate change, and natural resources management.
