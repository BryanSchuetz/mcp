Contracted by an international oil and gas company, DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) scoped and designed a corporate social investment project to address the issue of solid waste pollution in Saint-Louis. Our study provided a broad understanding of the solid waste challenge in Saint-Louis, detailed the key initiatives being undertaken, and proposed potential interventions that the client could spearhead. 

### Select Results

* Performed desktop research of key stakeholders, the legislative frameworks, academic literature, and economic environment.
* Completed field assessment to conduct interviews, site visits, and observations to map challenges of operating in the Saint-Louis environment, map available infrastructure against the needs of the community, and build the client’s understanding of local stakeholders and regional dynamics. 
* Held workshops and multiple discussions with the client over the course of the project to clarify criteria for a successful solid waste solution, build a framework for intervention evaluation and discuss the context and complexity of the environment. A range of potential interventions was considered, following an approach that considered several primary enabling environments factors: policy, regulation, and informal rules; infrastructure, machinery, and equipment; and the supply of and demand for solid waste management.
