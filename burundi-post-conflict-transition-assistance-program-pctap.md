###  Sample Activities

* Provide training to increase the capacity of newly elected officials to govern effectively and transparently.
* Promote a constructive relationship between elected officials and civil society through an improved understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities.
* Increase the capacity of the national government and civil society to plan and implement policies and build capacity in areas critical to post-conflict transition.

###  Select Results

* The good governance program trained 6,112 people in 111 communes, including 4,884 administrators, 1,036 members of civil society, 39 members of the media, and 153 traditional leaders.
* About 90 percent, or 116, of the 129 communal councils participated in an interprovincial competition, in which a selection committee chose 17 projects (one per province) to receive technical and financial support.
* Signed partnership agreements with seven national government entities designed to build their capacity.
