Over the course of the 2000s, Tajikistan experienced steady growth and poverty reduction after a decade of civil war. Nonetheless, as the global financial crisis of 2008 hit this trend slowed, with a drop of 35 percent in remittance flows—a key source of income for the country. Against this backdrop, the Government of Tajikistan set out a new public finance management (PFM) reform strategy, an ambitious agenda closely tied to the country’s development strategies. The 2030 National Development Strategy reinforced calls for deeper PFM reforms, while the 2020 Mid-Term Development Programme emphasised the need to strengthen parliamentary oversight of the sector. The importance of ensuring robust scrutiny was as vital as ever.

The Support to Parliamentary Oversight of the Public Financial Management (SPFM) Process in the Tajikistan Parliament programme supported the national parliament, and specifically its Economics & Finance Committee (EFC), to enhance its role. When functioning effectively, parliament is a key part of the governance framework, operating at the intersection of citizen-state and executive-legislature relations, and providing a mechanism of checks and balances.

The national budget is often the clearest indication of a government’s policy priorities. Parliament is the space in which these can be assessed and, if necessary, challenged, to ensure fair and equitable provision for all citizens. More specifically, the EFC is central to ensuring scrutiny and assessment of government plans for expenditure through its activities. 

SPFM strengthened the Tajikistan Parliament’s ability to fulfil its oversight responsibilities more effectively, efficiently, and accountably with regard to the management of public finances.
