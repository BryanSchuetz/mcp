The [Centre for Disaster Protection](https://www.disasterprotection.org/) focuses on managing risks relating to disasters, helping countries move from reaction to readiness, and planning better for future disasters.

The Centre works with a wide range of organizations—country governments, development banks, humanitarian agencies, development insurers, private sector actors, research institutions, and nongovernmental groups—to support partner countries to strengthen their pre-disaster planning and financial arrangements so they can respond more rapidly and effectively when a disaster strikes.

Sample Activities:

* Deliver a respected and widely used quality assurance function that increases the quantity and quality of risk financing products and services.
* Provide effective technical assistance and training that supports high-risk, vulnerable countries in making better risk management decisions.
* Drive change through evidence, experimentation, and learning that strengthens the global evidence base on risk financing.
* Through advocacy, improve the quality and quantity of risk financing provided through the multilateral system.

## Select Results

* Completed the first-ever comprehensive assessment of financial instruments used for pre-arranged disaster financing. The report, [Demystifying Pre-Arranged Financing for Governments](https://www.disasterprotection.org/publications-centre/demystifying-pre-arranged-financing-for-governments), seeks to help governments make sense of the instruments and assess their value based on seven critical criteria.
