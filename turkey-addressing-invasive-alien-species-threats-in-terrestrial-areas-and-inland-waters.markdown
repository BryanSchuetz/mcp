Invasive alien species are considered one of the main causes of marine and coastal biodiversity loss in Türkiye, posing one of the principal threats to coastal development in the country. Besides impacting native species and ecosystems, invasive alien species can have negative economic and social effects, as well as affect public health. 

Identification, eradication, and management of invasive alien species are cited in Türkiye’s National Strategy and Action Plan for Biodiversity. However, legislative gaps and lack of coordination among institutions in the country hinder its implementation.
 
The overall goal of [this project](http://teriasturk.org/) was to ensure the resilience of inland waters and terrestrial ecosystems in Türkiye with a specific focus on invasive alien species. It worked to get the species under control in targeted terrestrial areas and inland waters in line with European Union regulations. 

Our team supported Türkiye with the preparation of a legal instrument, developed action and management plans as well as built the institutional capacity of relevant authorities and actions to increase public awareness.
