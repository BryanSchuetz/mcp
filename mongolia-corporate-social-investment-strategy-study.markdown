DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) was selected in 2019 by an international mining company to conduct a study of innovative development models being implemented by corporations interested in having a real impact on socioeconomic and development outcomes of the countries in which they operate. SBG conducted a rapid desktop research study that identified a framework of 12 innovative development programs in line with international best practices and global trends. In partnership with the client, DAI provided a detailed analysis of how the identified development models scored across nine key criteria, including the role of company and stakeholders, opportunity to leverage external funding, long-term impact and sustainability, and resource considerations. SBG also provided case studies of some of our key projects to give more practical insights and lessons learned on the ground.
