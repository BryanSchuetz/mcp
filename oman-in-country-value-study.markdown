In 2019 DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) conducted a five-month in-country value (ICV) assessment to inform an international oil and gas company’s early-stage planning for their proposed petrochemical plant in Oman. The analysis looked across the construction, operation, and the downstream sale of the plant’s products to provide the following results: 

* Direct, indirect, and induced ICV impact estimates;  
* Analysis of the project’s fiscal revenues; 
* Estimation of import substitution effect from the project within Oman  
* Identification of opportunities for the client to increase ICV in local supply chains associated with the project;  
* Identification of investment opportunities for external and public sector investors that would result in significant ICV creation; and
* Assessment of ICV potential for contracting and procurement strategies being considered.   

SBG used its Local Content Optimization Model (LCOM) and leveraged its Muscat corporate office, its established impact assessment experience, and its experience from other oil and gas downstream work around the world to conduct the study.
