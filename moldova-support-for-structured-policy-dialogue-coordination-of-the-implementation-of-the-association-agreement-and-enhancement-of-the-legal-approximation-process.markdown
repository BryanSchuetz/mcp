With the signing of the European Union (EU)-Moldova Association Agreement (AA) in 2016 that included a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), Moldova opted for political association and economic integration with the EU. This AA/DCFTA was unprecedented and is expected to stimulate domestic reforms and to complete Moldova’s transition to a well-functioning market economy. Further implementation of the AA/DCFTA should bring Moldova the benefits of increased trade, integration into the EU single market, and institutional and socio-economic modernization.

The DAI-led technical assistance project works to increase the capacity of the Government of the Republic of Moldova and other key national institutions in implementing the EU-Republic of Moldova Association Agenda in line with the AA throughout all sectors. We are contributing to the acceleration of the AA/DCFTA implementation and making the process more participatory and transparent.

Drawing upon the best EU and international practices, we provide tailormade technical assistance to the central public authorities of the Republic of Moldova involved in the AA monitoring and implementation, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration; the State Chancellery; the Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of Economy and Infrastructure; the Parliament; and the other key project target groups to comprehensively address its needs.
