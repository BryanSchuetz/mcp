DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) provided oil and gas awareness training in Mauritania. The training was designed to improve understanding of the oil and gas industry among stakeholders, given the industry's increasing activity in the country. Participants included members of civil society, the media, and implementing partners. Training took place in Nouakchott and covered oil and gas fundamentals; legal, institutional, and fiscal aspects of the industry; and a half-day “Oil and Gas 101” module.
