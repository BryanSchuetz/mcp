Years of civil war left Liberia’s health care infrastructure in need of rebuilding. A key part of this involved ensuring all hospitals had essential medical equipment. DAI Global Health implemented a countrywide inventory of medical equipment in 20 hospitals, funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, to assess the health care technology management and maintenance requirements of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Liberia. 

The inventory also provided information on the availability of infrastructure such as power, water, and waste management. The project built capacity for the effective planning and management of procurement and maintenance of medical equipment at national level, by providing training on health care technology management software and on developing a maintenance plan. 

## Sample Activities

* Create detailed inventory and analysis for each hospital.
* Train employees and officials on health care software. 

## Select Results

* Produced an aggregated report on all facilities in the inventory.
* Analysed and made recommendations for power, water, and other utility improvements in the hospitals.
* Provided recommendations on medical equipment procurement within a budget.
* Built a database system containing all collected data on health care technology that was easily accessible and could be updated at regular intervals.
