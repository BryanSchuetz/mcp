DAI developed a feasibility study and final designs for a climate adaptation program for the Yaque del Sur River Basin in the Dominican Republic. Intended to promote environmental and social resilience, the program is based on an integrated water resource management system and an adaptive social protection mechanism.

Funded through Agence Française de Développement’s [Adapt’Action](https://www.afd.fr/en/adaptaction) Framework, the study informed a shared vision of the objectives of basin management and the actions necessary to manage the basin’s water resources in accordance with the requirements of sustainable, economically viable, and socially equitable development.

## Sample Activities

* Produce an in-depth characterization of the Yaque del Sur River Basin in terms of water resources, climate adaptation, environmental and social risks, socio-economic issues, and women's empowerment.
* Prepare a disaster risk and climate vulnerability assessment, analyzing existing practices, disaster and resource management mechanisms, and social protection programs that need to evolve or be modified.
* Identify and prioritize strategies to reduce vulnerability and define a proposal for a program of activities that will initiate the structuring of a Territorial Adaptation Plan for the basin in the face of climate and disaster management, prioritizing integrated water resources management and adaptive social protection.
