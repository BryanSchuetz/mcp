South Africa's Department of Trade and Industry-commissioned Black Business Supplier Development Programme (BBSDP) was a capacity-building program to address the constraints that many black-owned small enterprises faced in participating in the mainstream economy. Designed as successor to the BBSDP I program, which operated from 2001 to 2009, BBSDP II worked to mainstream small, medium, and micro-sized enterprises (SMMEs)—formal and competitive—with good potential for growth. The project fostered linkages between black-owned and managed businesses with large and established corporations, enabling black business to take advantage of South Africa's Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) policy and to close the equity gap for businesses requiring finance.
