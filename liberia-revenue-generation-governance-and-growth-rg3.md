Enhancing the government of Liberia's ability to collect taxes from its citizens is critical to the country's long-term development goals. However, tax evasion, poor tax policy, and ineffective enforcement all constrain the government's ability to [mobilize the domestic revenues](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/big-data-and-domestic-resource-mobilization-how-donors-can-help-developing-countries-increase-revenue?utm_source=daidotcom) it needs to provide basic services to citizens and promote economic growth and social development.

RG3 [assisted](https://www.liberianobserver.com/news/usaid-liberia-rg3-project-donates-it-equipment-to-lra/) the Liberia Revenue Authority (LRA) to improve its tax collection system and cultivate accountability among taxpayers. The project paired supply-side support to key government ministries with demand-side interventions that raise awareness of taxation responsibilities, [newly simplified payment methods](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/liberia-launches-mobile-tax-payments-opening-doors-to-increased-revenue-for-domestic-development), and the risks of noncompliance.

### Sample Activities

* Work with staff across the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) to build tax-related institutional capacity in policy design, organizational structure, and drafting of legislation.
* Facilitate meetings of stakeholders from the private sector, civil society, and government to develop a "fiscal pact" that makes the social contract of taxation explicit and tangible.
* Support the Government of Liberia to develop and roll out awareness campaigns through outreach tools such as billboards, social media, and radio ads.
* Establish and operationalize a toll-free call center to receive, route, and resolve taxpayers' questions in a customer service-oriented manner.

### Select Results

* Facilitated a [tenfold increase](https://www.dai.com/news/tenfold-increase-in-reported-tax-obligations-via-e-filing-marks-improved-transparency-governance-for-liberia)—from $1.2 million in Q3 2018 to $12.5 million in Q4 2018—in reported taxes due via e-filing.
* Increased taxpayer inquiries to the LRA call center tenfold through aggressive mobile text-messaging outreach.
* Conducted an innovative text-based taxpayer perception survey and a cost-of-compliance survey using computer-assisted telephone interviewing.
* Assisted LRA to establish a data processing center that improved transparency encompassing 70 percent of revenues and generates information to inform audit selection and improve revenue forecasting.
* Assisted in the establishment of the Taxpayer Advocate’s Office that supports taxpayers' rights in areas such as customs clearance and verification of tax compliance.
* Helped LRA allow taxes to be paid through commercial banks and their branches—as much as $7.3 million in taxes was paid using this method through August 2017.
* Increased tax payment transactions by 48 percent between March and August 2017, compared with the same period in 2016; this is expected to lead to increased revenues for the government.
* Developed, in cooperation with the MFDP, revised draft excise tax legislation that should help significantly increase revenue.
* Introduced mobile payments for all taxes and select nontax fees to reduce time and cost for taxpayers and eliminate risky cash transactions.
