Malaria is a serious public health problem in rural Zambia, particularly affecting children under 5. A variety of delays and barriers to successful treatment for severe malaria mean that incidence rates in Central Province between 2013 and 2015 were 495 per 1,000 children under 5 years.

The [MAMaZ Against Malaria (MAM)](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/health/malaria-children-zambia.html) project addressed the lack of access to quality commodities for case management of severe malaria in rural Zambia.

The project [increased access](http://www.transaid.org/news/josephines-story/) to community-based pre-referral treatment for severe malaria for children from six months to under 6 years old, and to reduce referral delays from the community to health facilities that are equipped to treat severe malaria.

The goal of the project was to devise an evidence-based and sustainable strategy for improving the access of hard-to-reach communities to effective treatment for severe malaria.

The project generated evidence showing that it is feasible to provide pre-referral treatment for severe malaria in the communities and improve case management of severe malaria at lower-level health facilities.

MAM used a health systems and operational research approach to address the constraints that limit knowledge of severe malaria at community level and access to quality medical drugs which undermine effect case management.

### Sample Activities

* Increase access to severe malaria commodities in remote areas.
* Intervene at the community level to reduce barriers and delays in treatment-seeking and increase patient completion of referral.
* Intervene at the facility level to optimize case management for severe malaria.

### Select Results

* [Provided proof](http://dai-global-developments.com/articles/zambia-pilot-shows-how-to-scale-relief-for-children-suffering-from-malaria/) that rectal artesunate administered in rural communities is a highly effective intervention for severe malaria among young children (6 months to 6 years old). The severe malaria mortality rate in this age group fell by 94.6 percent.
* Trained community health workers to mobilize their communities in support of a severe malaria agenda and to set up and manage systems to address the access and affordability barriers to services.
