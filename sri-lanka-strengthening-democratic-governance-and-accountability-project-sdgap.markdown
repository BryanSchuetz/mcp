Sri Lanka's new government has taken bold steps toward political and social change, including reinforcing the central role of parliament, and has introduced and bolstered independent oversight commissions. With a Constitutional Assembly forming to debate a new constitution for further democratic consolidation, the opportunity exists for a renewed partnership between the United States and Sri Lanka. Within this setting, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the Strengthening Democratic Governance and Accountability Project (SDGAP), a three-year program to strengthen public accountability systems; improve planning, communication, policy reform, and implementation; and increase the participation of women and under-represented groups in Sri Lanka.

The USAID-funded [Sri Lankan Parliament Project][1] (SLPP), also implemented by DAI, has helped to lay the groundwork for SDGAP by successfully facilitating multi-stakeholder dialogues on key reforms and by bringing together the prime minister, cabinet ministers, members of parliament, commissioners, and leading civil society organizations. DAI expanded upon these relationships and applied a local systems approach in improving Sri Lanka's existing systems we strengthened the relationship between government and civil society actors.

### Sample Activities

* Build the capacity of component institutions through parliamentary committees and commissions and facilitate cooperation and information sharing across institutions and with the public to strengthen the overarching political system.
* Assess how commissions and ministries use external research in policymaking and use results to create space for a broader group of stakeholders, including parliamentarians, nongovernmental organizations, think tanks, and female service users, to provide input into policy processes.
* Engage with the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration to introduce international best practices into the role of public servants in policy development and implementation.
* Provide technical assistance and grants to support government and civil society stakeholders to address priority laws and policies identified as affecting the rights of women and under-represented groups.

### Select Results

* Provided support to strengthen the laws in relation to corruption by drafting a consolidated law addressing, bribery, corruption, and asset declaration.
* Supported the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption to develop a National Action Plan for Combating Bribery and Corruption in Sri Lanka with four pillars: prevention; value-based education; institutional strengthening; and policy and legal reform. The consultative process spanned nine months across the nine provinces of the country with multi-party and multi-disciplinary stakeholder engagement.
* Facilitated Sri Lanka's participation in the Open Government Partnership (OGP) for the last three years, including the development of Sri Lanka's national action plans.
