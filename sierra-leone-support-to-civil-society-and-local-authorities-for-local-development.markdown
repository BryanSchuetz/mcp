Strengthening governance is key to achieve long-term internal peace and economic and social development in Sierra Leone. The country aims at improving the capacity of local governance structures to deliver appropriate services to local communities as part of a decentralization process. The Local Government Act 2004 (amended in 2017) provides the legal framework that guides this decentralization. Despite significant milestone achievements in the devolution of functions, fiscal autonomy, and service delivery, several challenges persist, in part due to the absence of a dedicated policy that can translate increasing political commitment to more meaningful powers for local councils.

Our assistance fosters decentralization by empowering local authorities as well as local and rural civil society groups in selected districts to plan and implement jointly agreed initiatives of service delivery, or capital investment that responds to the needs of communities. We help facilitate joint decision-making processes, where civil society, women, and young people contribute to public policymaking and service provision. Our assistance also supports relevant institutions at the central government in building inclusive and participative reform processes.
