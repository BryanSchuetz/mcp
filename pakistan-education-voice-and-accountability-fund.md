We implemented the Education Innovation and Voice and Accountability Fund (Ilm Ideas) for Pakistan from 2012 to 2015 to improve access to quality education in Pakistan by strengthening accountability and transparency mechanisms in the public and private education sectors. DAI piloted classroom interventions; scaled up and supported the uptake of evidence-based practices through public and private sector funding. The programme also supported innovative tools that promoted policy formulation and reform and raised the quality of education in mainstream schools for children with disabilities in Punjab. Ilm Ideas contributed to increased enrollment rates and retention, improved learning outcomes, enhanced parent and student satisfaction, and better education governance.
