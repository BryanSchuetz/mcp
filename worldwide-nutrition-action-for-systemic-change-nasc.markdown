Nutrition Action for Systemic Change (NASC) Technical Assistance Facility is managed by DAI and contracted through the [Expert Advisory Call Down Service 2 (EACDS2) Lot 4: Climate, Nature and Global Health](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-expert-advisory-call-down-services-2-eacds2-lot-4-climate-change-nature-and-global-health) funded by the U.K. Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO). EACDS2 technical advisory services provide rapid, quality-assured, short-term technical expertise to support the development of U.K. aid programs.

NASC provides technical expertise on nutrition and food systems, building on previous achievements and new initiatives funded by the FCDO. NASC supports the FCDO to uphold its commitments made at the 2021 [Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit](https://nutritionforgrowth.org/) to integrate nutrition across its aid portfolio in different sectors, spend at least £1.5 billion up to 2030 on programs that help improve nutrition, and adopt and embed the Nutrition Policy Marker (NPM) within FCDO systems. We will also work with the FCDO to integrate new commitments made at the 2025 Paris N4G Summit. The facility follows on from the [Technical Assistance to Strengthen Capabilities (TASC) Project](https://www.dai.com/our-work/projects/worldwide-technical-assistance-to-strengthen-capabilities?ref=pubs.ghost.io), which contributed to improved nutrition planning and programing and accelerated action on nutrition as part of the Technical Assistance for Nutrition (TAN) Programme. NASC had an initial one-year contract from December 2023 to December 2024 and is currently implementing a second contract from February 2025 to February 2026.

Our consortium partners are  [NutritionWorks](https://www.nutritionworks.org.uk/), [The Natural Resources Institute (NRI)](https://www.nri.org/) and [Options](https://options.co.uk/). 

NASC supports FCDO’s core nutrition objectives: 
1. Enhancing Nutrition Policy & Programming – Supporting FCDO in developing and implementing innovative, cost-effective nutrition policies and country plans aligned with government priorities.
2. Strengthening Global Engagement – Assisting in shaping FCDO’s nutrition strategy for the 2025 N4G Summit and collaborating with global partners to drive impact.
3. Improving Evidence & Risk Management – Using research to design effective programs, strengthen agriculture links, and integrate ‘do no harm’ principles.

The TA Facility will also continue to strengthen links with FCDO’s broader commitment to end preventable deaths of mothers, newborns, and children by 2030, including in fragile and conflict-affected settings.

Technical assistance is provided as short- or long-term expertise and targets programs across all stages, from design to implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and learning. NASC’s approach revolves around ensuring good coordination, communication, engagement, capacity building, and production of high-quality deliverables.
