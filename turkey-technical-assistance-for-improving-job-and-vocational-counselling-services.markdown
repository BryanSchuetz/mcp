Türkiye's labor market suffers from low employment rates, particularly among women and young people, and a mismatch between the demand for, and supply of, labor. The number of individuals with university or vocational qualifications has outpaced the market’s ability to absorb such workers. The private sector currently plays a limited role in fostering the demand for more and better skills—and 30 percent of the country's gross domestic product is linked to the informal sector, contributing to Türkiye’s low productivity relative to the European Union.

The Technical Assistance for Improving Job and Vocational Counselling Services project supported the Turkish Employment Agency (İŞKUR) to fulfil its mandate as the country's lead provider of public employment services. İŞKUR maintains a presence in all of Türkiye's provincial directorates, and with 3.5 million people registered as unemployed in 2018, there is significant demand for its services.

At the agency's 2018 staffing levels, each job and vocational counsellor was responsible for an estimated 900 unemployed people. While İŞKUR's recruitment of 830 counsellors in 2019  improved this ratio, the agency still faced an urgent need to deliver its services as effectively and efficiently as possible.

To do so, the project developed İŞKUR's institutional and human capacities, along with innovative tools to improve job matching and career guidance services and awareness-raising measures and coordination mechanisms. The project trained 6,000 staff of Türkiye’s and connected 10,000 job seekers with 280 employers—emphasizing inclusion of disadvantaged groups.
