This project increased the number of local suppliers of fresh produce in South Africa to Massmart, a subsidiary of Walmart, in concert with the country's black economic empowerment policy. It assisted farmers and cooperatives with the informed farm- and market-level support they need to link to Massmart's fresh produce supply chain. Additionally, we helped farmers access commercial production credit from banks and other sources. Together, this work resulted in sustainable improvement in the capacity of farmers to efficiently increase production and productivity of quality produce.
