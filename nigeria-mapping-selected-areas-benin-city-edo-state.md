We supported the establishment of a geographic information system (GIS) unit, then developed a system for improving the collection, management, and analysis of geospatial data to support government decision making in Edo State. We also built the capacity of local staff to help with the planning and monitoring of urban upgrading projects, violence prevention strategies, and other government initiatives. We strengthened the technical and managerial capacity of the city's GIS mapping unit to continue mapping activities across Edo State. We also created a mapping framework that outlines the technical, human, and financial resources and processes required for any governmental agency to map areas within Edo State.
