In April 2010, the Government of Kyrgyzstan and its president were brought down amid protests over corruption, abuse of power, and increasing utility prices. Within days a new Government assumed power, followed in June 2010 by a new constitution and parliamentary centric system. The elections to the new Parliament—the Jogorku Kenesh, or Supreme Council—were held on October 10, 2010. Challenges abound for the new parliamentarians; they face deep cynicism about state structures because both of Kyrgyzstan's post-Soviet Presidents fell into corruption and authoritarianism and were deposed after widespread protests. Tensions continue to simmer in the country's south between ethnic Uzbeks and Kyrgyz.

If Kyrgyzstan is able to meet these challenges, its new parliamentary system could sustain a reasonable balance of power that curbs corruption and incentivizes constructive politics. Its transition to a more democratic and effective form of governance could inspire other countries in the region. Failure of the new Parliament, though, could destabilize other states in Central Asia, particularly Uzbekistan. To effect reform and stability, the Parliament must work toward three intertwined objectives: being a more constructive actor in the Kyrgyz state system, a responsive and representative body, and a well-managed institution. DAI supported the Parliament (*Jogorku Kenesh*) in that effort.

In 2013, the former U.K. Department for International Development joined the project as a donor, enabling our work to be extended into 2015.
