On behalf of a Canadian association, DAI’s Sustainable Business Group (SBG) analyzed the technical and vocational education and training institutions and tertiary educational service providers in the energy sector across Nova Scotia to establish a series of recommendations to promote these activities regionally and internationally. The team mapped the training service providers by identifying both the existing institutions and their market base, including student origin and industrial sectors supported. The analysis identified key lessons learned from how these training service providers succeeded and/or failed to expand their offerings to meet the needs of the energy sector. The analysis also incorporated potential market growth opportunities for Nova Scotian training service providers and associated stakeholders to draw upon in the development of its promotion strategies.
