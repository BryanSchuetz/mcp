The Support to the National Malaria programme (SuNMaP) worked in close cooperation with Nigeria’s National Malaria Control Elimination Programme (NMEP) in 10 states and selected local governments within those states. Eventually covering around 40 percent of Nigeria’s population, SuNMaP rolled out activities in Anambra, Kano, Lagos, Niger, Ogun Jigawa, Enugu, Katsina and Yobe states. 

SuNMaP worked to improve capacity for national, state and local government area policy development; planning and coordination; harmonisation; prevention of malaria; treatment of malaria; awareness and demand creation; and operations research, monitoring and evaluation.

DAI Global Health’s Health Partners International (HPI) provided technical assistance in health systems strengthening for national and state-level capacity for policy development, planning, and coordination of malaria control activities. HPI’s key focus included providing technical and operational support in building local on-the-job capacity for management at all levels of the national malaria elimination programme.
