Since the end of its civil wars, Liberia has sought to strengthen the infrastructure sector, including developing a safer and more reliable road network. Liberia has a limited road system of only 10,600 kilometers, which falls short in terms of both safety and coverage, with rural areas often remaining isolated. Additionally, related institutions are limited with low technical and management capacity when it comes to dealing with operations, management, and private-sector vendors.

Under the Technical Assistance for the Implementation of Axle Load Control project, DAI is advancing Liberia's road network in line with standards established by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). We are working to improve the sustainability and security of the road transport system by curtailing vehicle overloading—deploying a mobile brigade to monitor loading, enforce penalties, and over time reduce the rate at which regional road corridors deteriorate.

### Sample Activities

* Strengthen transport regulations in Liberia in line with ECOWAS standards. 
* Improve governance of road maintenance, preventing traffic overloading on main transport corridors, and bolster the sustainability of road investments.
* Increase safety on the highways, improve traffic systems and reduce damages to the road pavement for effective vehicle load control.
