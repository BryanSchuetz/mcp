The National School of Government (NSG) in South Africa contributes to the establishment of a capable, professional, and responsive public sector that is committed to, and has institutionalized, the values and policies of a developmental state. The NSG plays a critical role in building the professionalization of public service through learning and development interventions.

DAI assisted the NSG in fulfilling its mandate. Our intervention strengthened the NSG as a training institution, rolled out three training programmes (Breaking Barriers to Entry, Compulsory Induction, and Reorientation), and strengthened the network and collaborations of the NSG to create new opportunities for the school and its beneficiaries.
