DAI Global Health and Montrose International implemented multiple studies to assess the costs and benefits of Results-Based Financing relative to Input-Based Financing in Northern Uganda. The studies aimed to isolate the main effect of the financing modality in terms of quality and quantity of health service provision. 

This project provided evidence—including how cost-effective programme approaches can be adapted to circumstances of fragility, poor governance, and weak systems—where unmet need in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health is often greatest.

The resulting “NU Health Policy Brief” was aimed at decision-makers and provided a concise outline of the implications and for policy and programme arising from Northern Uganda Health.

A second publication, “Northern Uganda Health Insights Report,” was aimed at programme planners and managers and provided a practical summary of the key learnings from Northern Uganda Health, with greater detail on context, design and learning.

Finally, a third publication, the “Northern Uganda Health Technical Annexes,” was aimed at technicians and investigators and complemented the Northern Uganda Health Policy Brief and Northern Uganda Health Insights Report to provide additional detail on the approaches, methodologies, and evidence presented in those documents.
