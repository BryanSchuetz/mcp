The Technical Assistance for Capacity Enhancement for Development and Implementation of Smart Specialization Strategies in Türkiye’s Regions (CEDIS3) will strengthen the capacity of national and regional actors to formulate and implement Smart Specialization Strategies. “Smart specialization” is an approach to economic development introduced by the EU that focuses on tailoring support to each region’s unique strengths and potential, moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach. Central to the project will be a Smart Specialization Advisory Board, through which we will deliver the expertise of key individuals responsible for the EU’s policy framework. The team will collaborate closely with Türkiye's government and stakeholders to ensure the best possible utilization of our global expertise.
