In the Republic of Moldova, the level of confidence that society has in the justice system is generally low. The European Union (EU)-Moldova Association Agenda 2017 requires that Moldova work toward improving the public perception of independence, integrity, transparency, and accountability of the judiciary as a medium-term priority. 

This project worked to accelerate the sustainable reform of the justice sector by supporting the implementation of the legislation to prevent and combat corruption in the justice sector in Moldova. A sound justice system is one of the key elements required to sustain investment flows and develop relationships and business activities. Improving public perception of the judiciary will play a significant role in stimulating the economic growth and stability of the country.
