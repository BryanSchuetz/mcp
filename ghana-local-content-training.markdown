The Sustainable Business Group (SBG) delivered training to officials from the Ghana Petroleum Commission in the local content regulations that spell out how the country must interact with foreign private sector investors. The course—a customization of the SBG/LCS industry-leading Local Content Master Class—was designed specifically to build capacity of the regulatory authority to execute their legal obligations. 

Attended by 24 officials, the course included models and software to optimize local content against targets and facilitate the verification of company local content plans and performance reports.
