With a free-market economy and a strong laissez-faire commercial tradition, Lebanon was, until recent years, a regional epicenter for commerce, banking, and innovation. Now deeply mired in a political and financial crisis, the country needs a new direction and assistance to revitalize the economy, restart financial and export markets, facilitate policy change, and drive new investments that will bring in foreign exchange and improve global competitiveness.

The Trade and Investment Facilitation (TIF) activity, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) boosts the exports of Lebanese goods and services, facilitates investment in Lebanese enterprises, and improves the business-enabling environment in Lebanon.

TIF focuses on the agrofood processing, manufacturing, knowledge economy and services, tourism and hospitality sectors. TIF has facilitated the export of $139.8 million in goods and services, supported the creation of 1,598 new jobs, and assisted 770 Lebanese enterprises in improving their products and processes to meet international standards.
